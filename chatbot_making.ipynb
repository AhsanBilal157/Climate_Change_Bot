Furthermore, Japan will continue strenuous efforts in its \\nchallenge to meet the lofty goal of cutting its emission by 50%. \\nIt is not only harmful g reenhouse gases that humanity emits into the environment. \\nWhile socio-economic activities characterized by mass production, mass consumption \\nand mass waste have benefited us greatly, such activities have wasted the Earth’s limited \\nresources and hampered the natural cyclical change of materials, imposing a heavy load \\non the global environment. \\n \\nAgainst this background, we must ensure the development and prosperity of '),\n",

To this end, it is essential to reduce \\nemissions of greenhouse gases and other substances that negatively impact the \\nenvironment (hereinafter, “greenhouse gases and others”) across all sectors. In particular, \\nit will be an  overridingly important approach to strive to reduce emissions of \\ngreenhouse gas es and others  by addressing the reduction of environmental loads in \\nconnection with the award of contracts. \\nThe emissions of Greenhouse gases and others related to power supply, procurement \\nof automobiles, procurement of ships, energy conservation improvement, refurbishment \\nand construction, for which details on the award of contracts to address reductions of \\nemissions of greenhouse gases and others (hereinafter, ‘‘green contracts’’) are stipulated \\nby this Basic Policy, account for about 90% of the total greenhouse gas emissions \\nsourced from the Government. In \" the National Government Action Plan  (Cabinet \\ndecision on October 22, 2021)\" based on Article 20 of the Act on Promotion of Global \\nWarming Countermeasures (Law No.117 of 1998), \"using the FY 2013 level as the \\nbenchmark, greenhouse gas emissions directly and indirectly emitted in connection with \\naffairs and projects of each governmental administrative organ should be reduce 50% by \\nFY 2030.

The nation \\nhas been consistently driving international and regional cooperation, enabling a \\nnumber of successful global projects. Its increasingly stronger economic prowess \\nand international acclaim have enabled Azerbaijan to launch a number of large-scale \\nprojects capable of transforming the South Caucasus and adjacent regional \\neconomies. Through successful implementation of these projects Azerbaijan has \\neffectively become a 'global player' underpinning the region's development vision, \\nwith a say in the global economy. \\nThe government's special role in the social and economic development context, \\nwith oil resources utilized in the dynamic development process in an efficient and \\nsmart way, as well as high public investment spending, have been instrumental in \\naddressing the key aspirations of the first phase of the country's economic agenda of \\nstrengthening the nation's sovereignty and national security through reinstatement of \\nthe historic geographic boundaries, and driving domestic social and political stability, \\nand societal consolidation. \\nDespite the recent significant export revenue impact of COVID-19, the \\ngovernment's timely response enabled the national economy to quickly adapt to the \\nnew global context, securing macroeconomic stability and empowering Azerbaijan to \\nmanage the crisis as one of the least scarred economies. \\nThe post-COVID and post-conflict period of 2022-2030 ushers in a new and \\ncompletely different strategic development phase for Azerbaijan. In this strategic \\nperiod, Azerbaijan aspires to reach new heights in building a well-being society \\nthrough further development by engaging state-of-the-art and sustainable growth \\ndrivers, placing a stronger focus on innovation and financial stability, and global value \\nchain integration, deploying a new generation structural and institutional adjustment measures. \\nAll of the above prompted the approval of the Azerbaijan 2030: National \\nPriorities for Social and Economic Development, entailing, in turn, the present 2022- \\n2026 Social and Economic Development Strategy. Implementation of the Strategy \\nwill drive significant shifts in the economy, with growth based on a completely new \\nset of enablers, and a boost to the growth pace, in particular in priority industries, \\nwhile the economy as a whole and employment become increasingly stronger by 2026. \\nNew and more efficient enablers and development context will boost private \\nsector development, including micro, small and medium enterprise, enhancing \\nforeign investor activity and non-input exports. \\nINTERNAL.

National Priorities for Social and Economic Development: Achievements \\nand Challenges \\n1.1. Key achievements of the last decade \\nFive fundamental outcomes, namely a victorious nation, a worldwide \\nacclaim, an educated society, a strong economic potential and a growing well\\xad \\nbeing characterize the last decade of the country's social and economic \\ndevelopment. These achievements will provide a considerable contribution to the \\nformulation of the country's new social and economic development landscape in the \\nlong run, and are a direct consequence of the last decade's wide-ranging reform \\naspirations. Only a handful of countries have ever been able to become such a \\nsuccess story in as little as 30 years. \\nRestoration of the country's territorial integrity unlocks opportunities for \\neconomic development. The liberation of our lands and restoration of the country's \\nterritorial integrity by the valiant Azerbaijani Army is an unrivaled achievement in the \\nnation's age-long history. Restoration of the territorial integrity stems directly from 30 \\nyears of the government's consistent reforms and forward-looking foreign policy \\naimed at further strengthening Azerbaijan. The entire nation rallied behind the \\nPresident of Azerbaijan from the very first day of the war, with the invincibility and \\nheroism of Azerbaijan's victorious armed forces on display. Both military and political \\n& diplomatic advancements showed the world just how strong the country is. \\nIn the past 10 years, the country has achieved macroeconomic stability \\nand sustainability, as well as welfare-centric growth. Strong political & social \\nstability and security, a forward-looking domestic and foreign policy have been \\ninstrumental to achieving the complex social and economic goals set in the past 10 \\nyears, as well as to restoring the country's territorial integrity. Widespread technology \\ndeployments and promotion of high-quality human capital in key industries have \\nsignificantly boosted productivity, speeding up economic diversification and efficient \\nglobal value chain integration of domestic production. As an active 4th Industrial \\nRevolution center, Azerbaijan has become a treasure trove of opportunities for \\nforeign investors. To wit, during this period the national economy has grown 15%, \\nwhile non-hydrocarbon Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has increased 1.4 times. \\nFurthermore, non-hydrocarbon exports have increased 78.3% from the 2011 levels. \\nIn the past 10 years, the country has successfully tackled two global \\nfinancial crises as the national economy remained resilient to external shocks. \\nWith global oil prices dropping by up to 3 times in 2014- 2015, and the ongoing \\nCOVID crisis since early 2020, the country's macroeconomic stability has been \\nexposed to major threats. However, the government's flexible and efficient economic \\nmanagement measures have secured the country's macroeconomic stability, as well \\nas public well-being and health. As of the end of 2021, the country's total foreign \\nexchange reserves were almost as high as GDP, exhibiting the national economy's \\nresilience to external and domestic shocks. \\nThe ongoing in-depth structural and institutional adjustments have \\nmodified the national economy's structure with the non-oil sector's share \\nsignificantly increased. In 2012- 2021, non-hydrocarbon GDP grew 3,5% p.a. on \\naverage, increasing from AZN25,4 bin in 2011 to AZN57,8 bin in 2021; respectively, \\nthe share of the non-hydrocarbon sector increased from 48,8% in 2011 to 62,2% in \\n2021. During this period of time, as sector-based growth drivers, non-hydrocarbon \\nindustry has grown 2,3 times, agriculture by 1,5 times, and ICT by 2,4 times. The \\nINTERNAL.

Backed by successful structural and \\ninstitutional adjustments, the private sector's share of GDP totaled 85% by 2019, and \\nwhile it dropped to 80,8% in 2020 due to COVID, it quickly rebounded to more than \\n83% as early as in 2021. The private sector's advancement was primarily driven by \\nprivate non-hydrocarbon investment, reaching 44,6% of total non-hydrocarbon \\ninvestments by 2021. \\nSmall and medium businesses increasingly dominate the economy. State\\xad \\nof-the-art economic arrangements and facilities, in particular financed from public \\ninvestments, have facilitated SME development. Over this period of time, the number \\nof registered SMEs has increased 3, 1 times, with their share of non-hydrocarbon \\nGDP totaling 23,7%. SMEs account for 25,5% of total non-hydrocarbon exports. The \\nSME soft loan portfolio increased 1,5 times from 2018 reaching AZN4,4 bin by 2021. \\nThe domestic production capacity and infrastructure are being developed \\nto further improve the country's food security situation. Overall, the country has \\nan adequate agricultural production capacity to be self-sufficient based on the \\nexisting land, water and climate resources. On top of the domestic production \\npotential, the arrangements put in place to promote development of agricultural \\nstorage facilities and processing industry are extremely important. Thus, developing \\na domestic processing industry and infrastructure for products with a relatively high \\nimport dependency due to resource scarcity is expected to accommodate the \\ncountry's stable food security needs in full. \\nForeign investments have been instrumental to rapid non-hydrocarbon \\ndevelopment, in particular private undertakings. Foreign direct investments to \\nnon-hydrocarbons in Azerbaijan totaled USD11, 1 bin in 2011- 2021. Foreign \\ninvestments aimed at enabling a competitive value chain and state-of-the-art \\ninfrastructure in high-productivity industries, with investments actively promoted \\nowing to a favorable business climate and macroeconomic stability. \\nState budget has been active in both supporting well-being and investing \\nto boost economic activity. Although global and domestic economic developments \\nhave affected the revenues, expenditures increased 1,8 times in nominal terms \\nduring 2011-2021. \\nDomestic and external debt has supported the macroeconomic stability \\nand fiscal sustainability goals. Debt stock totaled 18,2% of GDP as of December \\n31, 2021, which is acceptable from a fiscal sustainability standpoint. On the heels of \\nrecent increases, domestic borrowing has reached AZN2.507, 1 min by December 31, \\n2021, which is important for the development and efficient performance of financial markets. \\nIn the past 10 years, inflation rate has been maintained at an acceptable \\nlevel for economic activity. During this period, annual inflation was 5,3% on \\naverage. The monetary stance followed closely the macroeconomic stability targets. \\nTo support economic recovery, the policy rate was decreased from 15% in early \\n20_18 to 6,25% by December 2020 in 16 increments. However, the policy rate \\nadjustments were put on hold due to external developments in the first half of 2021 \\nfollo~ed by a gradual increase in response to accelerating inflationary pressures \\n~tart,~g from the second half of the year.

A state-of-the-art water management infrastructure \\nhas been developed, effective waste management facilities have been expanded, \\nand new RES capacities have been added. \\nCOVID-related threats have been successfully mitigated as the global \\neconomy is going through changes. High-quality human capital, technology \\nadoption and sustainable growth remain the key enablers of global competitiveness. \\nHowever, countries worldwide have started to apply new strategic solutions in order \\nto adapt to the technological shift driven by the new wave of industrialization. \\nAzerbaijan has developed a high social & economic well-being and capacity to \\nminimize the impact of such changes. \\n1.2. Global trends, challenges and opportunities in the next ten years \\nThe country's economy is bound to face new globally and domestically\\xad \\ninduced challenges in the long run. As our national economy is small and highly \\nintegrated into the global economy, it is vulnerable to lasting external challenges, \\nwhich requires the structure of the economy to be changed. These challanges are \\nmulti-faceted. \\nThe economy needs to grow rapidly and continually in the long-term in \\norder for Azerbaijan to become a high income country. 13 countries have \\ndemonstrated 7%+ growth rate p.a. on average in the past 25 years. These countries \\nhave been able to shorten the gap to high income countries through rapid, \\nsustainable and equitable growth. Our country aspires to become a high income \\neconomy. This would require a new growth model that incorporates sustainability and \\nequity characteristics. Only this growth model could enable continuous income \\ngrowth for everyone in Azerbaijan. \\nRapid digitalization trends and the associated significant productivity \\nboosts across world economies give rise to substantial development \\nopportunities. As technology increasingly advances, the global value chain is \\nrapidly becoming stronger as its geography expands. This allows for timely, quality \\nand low-cost delivery of global commodities and services to end user. Digital society \\nconsumers are able to track their orders throughout the entire value chain. Using this \\ntrend would support the country's quick global value chain integration. \\nThe global 'greening and de-carbonization' trends create development \\nopportunities for non-resource economies. As these trends pick up pace, they \\ncould affect the country's oil revenues in the long run. The decline of global oil \\ndemand requires deep non-hydrocarbon diversification and non-hydrocarbon FX \\nrevenues to off-set the decreasing oil revenues. Climate action, efficient utilization of \\nnatural resources and biodiversity protection are key for a sustainable economy. The \\nSustainable Development Goals, as well as addressing the climate change \\nchallenges identified under the Paris Accord and achieving the country's \\ndevelopment priorities require increased RES capacity additions and application of \\nenvironment-friendly energy efficient technologies. \\nINTERNAL.

Just like in urban areas, creation of education facilities, \\nhealthcare facilities, community culture centers, essential utilities and development \\nservices in rural areas relies on digital technologies. All of this has significantly \\nreduced the urban vs. rural quality of life gap. The village planning and settlement \\nprocess considers any given region\\'s existing and potential role in the economic \\nvalue chain. \\nWith globalization processes accelerating and financial crisis frequency \\nincreasing, a greater focus is placed on macroeconomic and financial stability. \\nMacroeconomic stability and sustainability are key pre-requisites for long-term \\ncontinuous growth. Low and stable inflation, sustainable exchange rate, as well as \\nstability across the financial sector drive domestic and external investment. \\nCompetition is increasing for global direct investments. Such investments \\nrequire a sound and transparent business climate, macroeconomic sustainability and \\nfinancial stability. Unless the aforementioned conditions are in place, barriers may \\nexist for an inflow of foreign direct investments that bring technology and knowledge \\ntransfer. Practice shows that foreign direct investments as a key driver of rapid \\ngrowth may form a high quality human capital on top of creating new sustainable jobs \\nin the country. \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic increases the relevance of health, food security \\nand sustainable employment challenges for world economies. With digital \\napplications in healthcare, agile and contactless healthcare services are expanding \\nand more people gain inexpensive access to healthcare services. Adequate \\ncontagion safeguards cannot be provided by a strong healthcare system and \\npreventive measures alone. It is also necessary to ensure healthy and adequate \\nnutrition in order to foster the required immunity. In order to both tackle the food \\nsupply issues and fend against the high food price volatility, countries stockpile \\nstrategic food supplies for the long run. The economic developments affect the labor \\nmarket as well; in particular, emerging skills and declining demand for a range of \\nexisting skills require a measured employment response. \\nApplication of digital technologies and development opportunities of low\\xad \\ncontact sectors increase the demand for high capabilities. A combination of two \\nstrategic plays is used to address these needs. The first play is to develop a new \\neducation content to match the current economic requirements. The second play is to \\ndevelop lifelong learning opportunities to re-train the existing workforce. Implemented \\nin parallel, both plays would benefit economic diversification and rapid digitalization. \\nPromotion of intellectual activity, and support to innovation and creativity \\nis enhanced in key sectors. Promotion of intellectual activity outputs, innovation \\nand creativity play an important role in continually enhancing the value chain footprint \\nof the intellectual property-based intangible capital in the form of technologies, design \\nand brands. In this view, development support should be provided to the IP-intensive \\ncreative economy, cooperation should be fostered among creative and digital \\ntechnology experts, and the quality of professional training should be improved. \\nThe key success of world economies in supporting well-being is striking a \\nbalance between high-income and indigent populations. A focus should be \\nplaced not on \"earning income based on access to high productivity\", but rather on \\n\"improving productivity for all ensuring equal access to work or business \\nINTERNAL.

This balance should be always realized through the state\\'s social & \\neconomic development and regulatory function. \\nSustainable employment facilitates continuous well-being of people and \\noptimizes the state\\'s social burden. Creation of competitive value chains and \\nimprovement of education supports creation of sustainable jobs worldwide. With \\npromotion of foreign investments and application of digital technologies, domestic \\nproduction and services will be integrated in the global value chain, which will help \\ncreate competitive and sustainable employment opportunities and ultimately improve \\npeople\\'s well-being. \\nAs the great chronicle of Azerbaijan\\'s success unfolds, an effective social \\nand economic re-integration of the de-occupied lands is underway. Achieving \\nthis strategic objective requires gradual rebuild and development, creation of a state\\xad \\nof-the-art social and business infrastructure widely using digital technologies, and \\nsustainable settlement of the de-occupied lands following prioritization, considering \\nefficiency requirements and best practices. All of this is being done through \\ninternational cooperation based on best practices and approaches. Full capture of \\nthe economic potential of the de-occupied lands for the nation\\'s well-being, in \\nparticular implementation of the regional transport projects via the Zangezur corridor \\nunlock strong opportunities for continuous and sustainable development. Based on \\nthe rebuild progress so far, it is evident that these goals and objectives are well on \\ntrack to be achieved. This is assured by a long-term vision, and availability of the \\nrequried resources and solutions. \\n2. Azerbaijan - 2030: A strong state and a high well-being society \\n2.1. The country\\'s social & economic development model for the next decade \\nThe key outcomes of the existing social & economic development model are the \\nrestoration of Azerbaijan\\'s territorial integrity, impovement of the country\\'s \\ninternational acclaim, reinforcement of the economic potential and a significant \\nimprovement of the people\\'s social well-being. By further strengthening the country\\'s \\nsocial and political stability, this model has enabled sustainable growth, increasing \\nthe well-being and continuous stability. Diversification and export potential have been \\nenabled for further development by efficiently utilizing oil revenues for social and \\neconomic purposes. Effective public governance has been instrumental to achieving \\nthese outcomes. \\nThe content and structure of the current social & economic model will be \\nsignificantly updated in order to achieve the next strategic objective of becoming \\'A \\nstrong state and a high well-being society\\'. The Azerbaijan 2030: National Priorities \\nfor Social and Economic Development that were approved in this context will be \\nimplemented based on the updated social & economic growth model focused on the \\nbest practice-based development ideas. This model would mobilize and use all of the \\ncountry\\'s resources and accomplishments to achieve the long-term strategic goals. \\nThe new social & economic development model rationalizes the fundamental \\nreforms to be implemented in the country across the board by 2030. At the core of \\nthe rationale are creative entrepreneurs, productive investments, development of \\ninnovation-supporting intellectual property and competitive markets. \\nINTERNAL.

The key \\nobjective of this phase is to reinstate high, sustainable, inclusive growth rates in order \\nto achieve a stable living standard for each Azerbaijani citizen, primarily focusing on \\nthe quality rather than the scale of growth. \\nThe new growth model will rely on private initiatives, good quality and \\nsound human capital during the strategic period. A competitive, open economy \\nmodel focused on sustainable, inclusive development will be the key driver of the \\nmodernization strategy. \\nCompetitiveness will enable a stable growth of the national income per \\ncapita in the long run and an increase of people's living standard. \\nCompetitiveness of the economy will be increased by deepening productivity as a \\nkey enabler.

This model will create equal \\nopportunities and possibilities for all. Only skills will be fundamental to success in all \\nareas. \\nThe new development model will create a uniform economy - a best \\npractice-based value chain covering the de-occupied lands as well.

Description of the 2022-2026 Social and Economic Development Strategy \\n3.1. Strategic framework for the sustainably growing competitive economy \\nEconomic diversification and increased non-oil exports will drive a \\ncontinuous and high growth. High quality exports will facilitate the global value \\nchain integration of the national economy. To this end, a more robust and competitive \\nbusiness climate will be facilitated, with the government extensively supporting \\nenterprise development. SOE efficiency and accountability will be improved. \\nConsequently, the national economy will grow on average 3-4% p.a., with non\\xad \\nhydrocarbon GDP growing on average 5% p.a. The private sector's share in the \\neconomy will be increased to reach 88%. \\nRule of law and an effective judiciary reform will be provided to enable a \\nrobust and competitive business climate. These reforms will afford effective \\nprotections to business ownership and interests. Excessive regulation of businesses \\nwill be optimized. Adverse competition impacts of natural monopolies will be curtailed \\nand competition will be strengthened across markets. Transparency and efficiency of \\npublic procurements will be improved. Tax and other fiscal incentives will be rolled \\nout for investments. These reforms will help further improve the robustness of the \\nbusiness climate spurring confidence gains for the national economy and ultimately \\nmore domestic and foreign investments. \\nEffectiveness, targeting and transparency of the government's enterprise \\nsupport mechanisms will be improved. Best practice experiences will inform the \\nimprovement of support mechanisms for business startups and incubators, export\\xad \\noriented manufacturing and service business initiatives. Consequently, new financing \\nmechanisms will be made available to individuals aspiring to start a business or \\nexpand an existing business, in particular small and medium businesses. In this \\ncontext, 20-30% of the enterprise support funding is expected to go to micro, 35-45% \\nto small and 25-35% to medium enterprises. \\nSOE efficiency, governance and transparency will be improved. \\nPerformance, financial sustainability and competitiveness of Azerbaijan Investment \\nHolding's portfolio SOEs will be improved. The state's direct participation in the \\neconomy will be optimized, with steps taken to gradually privatize state-owned \\nassets, except strategic industries, which would reduce the public funding needs and \\nrisks. Furthermore, performance of enterprises not considered appropriate for \\nprivatization for a certain period of time will be improved through commercialization \\nor operatorship arrangements. \\nINTERNAL.

Financing \\nwill be facilitated through privatization of state-owned enterprises (except strategic \\nindustries) and public-private partnership arrangements. Public investments will \\nbecome more effective and will develop a greater capacity to promote private \\ninvestment. New mechanisms will be developed and direct investor dialogue \\nmechanisms will be deployed to stimulate FDls to priority sectors. The use of the \\nfinancing capacity of international development institutions, in particular those \\nspecialized in private sector finance, will be improved increasing non-hydrocarbon \\nFDls by 10-15% p.a. \\nA legal framework will be developed to facilitate digital with government \\nregulatory oversight provided. Schemes will be deployed to incentivize digital; in \\nthis context, internet, high-speed mobile internet (incl. 5G), and in particular \\nbroadband internet coverage will be increased to 95%. \\nTechnology deployments in agriculture, manufacturing and service \\nindustries will increase productivity and employment. Government-provided \\nincentives will support a sustainable global value chain integration of these \\nindustries. The government will be actively involved in the development of an \\ninfrastructure supporting agriculture, manufacturing and service industries; a diverse \\nset of industrial estates and sites, tourism and recreation zones will be developed, \\nwith exports promoted. Consequently, agriculture will grow on average 4% p.a. \\nduring 2022-2026. The transport sector will have an annual average growth rate over \\n5%. The country's cargo transit revenues will increase by up to 2x from AZN227 min \\nin 2019 to AZN450 min. Non-hydracrbons will grow on average 8,3% p.a., while \\nindustrial estates will account for 15% of manufacturing output and 25% of total non\\xad \\nhydrocarbon exports. ICT will grow on average 10%+ p.a., construction around 3% \\np.a. By 2026, value addition of the hospitality industry will increase 1,5x compared to \\n2019. \\nMacroeconomic stability and sustainability will be provided with stability \\nstrengthened across the financial sector in order to facilitate sustainable \\ngrowth. Strengthening macroeconomic and financial stability is important for growth \\ncontinuity. The country's macroeconomic sustainability reliant on large strategic \\nreserves will improve the national economy's resilience to external shocks. The \\nregulatory framework will be refined for fiscal stability with annual inflation anchored \\nin the 4±2% range and non-oil primary balance downscaled to 17,5% by 2026; in this \\ncontext, a sustainable level of SOFAZ assets will be maintained. Domestic borrowing \\nwill be used to cover the financing needs during the coming years translating to debt \\nstock to GDP ratio maintained at 20%, with external public debt to GDP ratio locked \\nat 10% by end-2026. \\nThe role of all financial sector segments in the economy will be increased. \\nThe banking sector's financing input to the economy will be increased, with financial \\ninclusion, accessibility of financial services and access to finance for households and \\nbusinesses alike improved. Investor and creditor risk insurance schemes will be \\nimproved for PPP arrangements with the coverage of the business loan guarantee \\nmechanism expanded. Investment and ICT literacy of households and businesses \\nwill be improved as financial services are digitized.

In this context, financial depth indicators will be continually improved, as \\nnational payment system transactions of economic operators increase by 25% with \\ncashless transactions increased to 55% of total card-based transactions. \\nExports will be diversified and non-oil exports will be expanded. The \\nregulatory framework for governance and institutional mechanisms will be improved \\nin order to facilitate exports. High-quality domestic production of export-oriented \\ngoods and e-exports will be developed; government support to non-hydrocarbon \\nexport promotion will be enhanced with non-hydrocarbon increasing to 85% by 2026 \\nfrom 2021 levels. \\n3.2. Strategic framework for a dynamic, inclusive and equitable society \\nWages will be increased and a decent quality of life for all will be \\nprovided. Minimum wages will be increased in order to provide a decent quality of \\nlife for wage earners. An acceptable net minimum wage to net monthly average wage \\nratio will be maintained. \\nNew private sector jobs will be created and employment will be increased. \\nJob generating enterprise will be incentivized. Effective employment and decent labor \\nwill be achieved for different groups, informality countering and oversight will be \\nstrengthened by enabling development of SMEs and self-employment, in particular in \\nrural areas, leading to an increase of public sector employment from 77 ,6% in 2021 \\nto 80%. As a result of measures to gradually reduce informality, the public sector will \\naccount for 50% (against 46,9% in 2021) of wage earners (salaried personnel). \\nAn equitable and comprehensive social safety net will be formed for all \\npeople. Access to effective savings for pensioners, basic needs coverage for low\\xad \\nincome households and social assistance for disabled persons will be improved. The \\npension system will become more sustainable and the social insurance rollout will be \\nexpanded. An equality-of-access-for-all social safety net will be developed. Minimum \\npension will be maintained at 75-80% of the minimum wage. \\nWomen's access to economic opportunities will be improved. Women's \\neconomic activity will be enhanced with active promotion of women's participation in \\nhigh-paying industries. Career guidance and counselling, and other active \\nemployment measures will be expanded to facilitate women's success. The ratio of \\nwomen's monthly average wage to that of their male counterparts will be increased \\nfrom 65,8% in 2021 to 80%. \\nUrban vs. rural living standard disparities will be reduced. Economic and \\nnatural capacities of rural areas will be efficiently utilized, with investments promoted \\nand government support provided to regional development mechanisms in line with \\nnew challenges.

The \\nprogress of the 2022-2026 Social & Economic Development Strategy and the \\nassociated action programs will be monitored and measured against the targets sets. \\nFindings will be reported and any interventions required for any program or activities \\nwill be communicated.

Monitoring and evaluation of targets \\nSets of results, outputs and outcomes are defined as metrics to track activities \\nunder the 2022-2026 Social & Economic Development Strategy. Delivery \\n(implementation status) of different activities will be measured against these targets. \\nThe baseline year is 2021. Results cover each year throughout the implementation \\nperiod, outputs are annual metrics covering 2023, 2024 and 2025, while outcomes \\ncover 2026. Results will be measured in a structured way, achievement, \\neffectiveness, and consistency and durability of outcomes will be determined. This \\nwould allow for evaluating the implementation status of the 2022-2026 Social & \\nEconomic Development Strategy on an annual basis. The M&E activities will be \\nguided by the Design, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Protocol for State \\nPrograms as approved by the March 6, 2021 Presidential Decree (No.1294 ). \\n7. Implementation plan \\nAn implementation plan has been developed that aims to unlock the enablers \\nthrough delivery of a broad set of activities during the initial strategic period. \\nINTERNAL.

The PCC facilitates dialogue \\nbetween social partners on these issues—defining the \\ntype of economy and society we want to achieve, \\nand detailed pathways for how to get there.\\nAbout the Just Transition Framework\\nThe just transition framework brings coordination \\nand coherence to just transition planning in South \\nAfrica. The just transition framework sets out a \\nshared vision for the just transition, principles to \\nguide the transition, and policies and governance \\narrangements to give effect to the transition. \\nINTRODUCTION\\nSouth Africa is in a part of the world that is severely \\nimpacted by climate variability. The country frequently \\nexperiences droughts, floods, and other extreme \\nweather events, with evidence that the frequency and \\nintensity of such events are increasing because of cli-\\nmate change (IPCC 2022). These events have already \\ncaused enormous damage to infrastructure, ecosys-\\ntems, lives, and livelihoods, and displaced thousands of \\npeople, and continue to be a stark reminder that it is \\npoorer communities—women and young people, the \\nunemployed, those living in informal settlements—\\nthat are most vulnerable to climate change. Climate \\nchange also places significant stress on food security \\nand South Africa’s already-constrained water resources, \\ncreating knock-on impacts in other sectors (DFFE \\n2019; NPC 2020). \\nClimate change exacerbates South Africa’s triple \\nchallenges of poverty, unemployment, and inequality. \\nSouth Africa is one of the most unequal countries in \\nthe world; the divide between the rich and the poor is \\nlarger than ever; currently, the unemployment rate, at \\nover 35 percent, is at record levels (StatsSA 2022). The \\nhealth impacts from the burning of fossil fuels (a major \\ndriver of climate change) also impacts poorer com-\\nmunities, further highlighting these inequities (Gray \\n2019; Madonsela et al. 2022). The PCC’s community \\nengagements in the early part of 2022 identified the \\nhardships that many South Africans are experiencing. \\nWorkers, jobseekers, and community members have \\nspoken passionately and articulately about the unfair-\\nness of their current situations, the inequalities they \\nexperience, and their visions for a more equal and more \\ninclusive society (PCC 2022a). At the same time the \\ncapacity of the state to respond to these challenges has \\nnever been weaker, and communities have expressed \\nthe view that the state is failing them.\\nIt is in South Africa’s national interests to join the \\nworld in combating climate change, in accordance with \\nnational circumstances and development priorities. \\nThis is not only an environmental imperative, but an \\neconomic one too, as countries around the world start \\nto shift toward low-emissions policies, affecting global \\ntrade as well as demand for goods and resources. \\nAddressing climate change means strengthening adap-\\ntation measures to improve the resilience to immediate \\nevents (e.g., extreme weather, disasters) as well as \\nlong-term climatic shifts that impact water security, '),\n",

Addressing climate change also necessitates sharp \\nreductions in greenhouse gas emissions—the harmful \\npollutants that drive climate change. The scale of the \\nchallenge also demands an effective State, significant \\ngovernment capacity, and trust among all stakehold-\\ners, which has been significantly eroded in recent years \\nbecause of the loss of accountability and professional \\nethos linked to state capture (The Presidency 2022). \\nTackling climate change will require urgent, significant, \\nand transformational changes across all sectors of the \\nSouth African economy. It will require innovations in \\nurban and infrastructure planning; a massive shift to \\nclean energy sources; and changes to how we use our \\nland, water, and obtain our food (IPCC 2022). The \\nchanges will be difficult for some, particularly the work-\\ners and communities whose lives and livelihoods are \\ntied to fossil fuel industries, as well as the women, the \\nyouth, and the poor, who are already disproportion-\\nately bearing the brunt of South Africa’s hardships and \\ntriple challenges. Managing the transition will require \\nstrategies that both deal with the unavoidable burdens \\narising from the transition, as well as strategies that \\nseize the opportunities offered by the green economy, \\nwith wide sharing of benefits. \\nPeople must be at the centre of the climate change \\nresponse (ILO 2015; DFFE 2022). Indeed, the aim \\nis a just transition: seizing the opportunities and \\nmanaging the risks associated with climate change, \\nwith an overarching goal of improving the lives and \\nlivelihoods of ALL South Africans, particularly those \\nmost impacted. The scope of a just transition is wide, \\nboth in the focus on people, and on the time scales of \\naction and delivery.\\nABOUT THE JUST \\nTRANSITION FRAMEWORK\\nWhat is the Just Transition \\nFramework?\\nOne of the first tasks of the Presidential Climate \\nCommission (PCC) was to design a just transition \\nframework for South Africa. In December 2020, \\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa created the PCC to oversee \\nand facilitate a just transition to a low-emissions and \\nclimate-resilient economy. The just transition frame-\\nwork is the first building block towards this objective, \\nbringing coordination and coherence to just transition \\nplanning in the country. The just transition framework \\nsets out a shared vision for the just transition, principles \\nto guide the transition, and policies and governance \\narrangements to give effect to the transition. \\nHow was the Just Transition \\nFramework Developed?\\nThe just transition framework builds on research, pol-\\nicies, and consultations on the just transition in South \\nAfrica, as well as international best practice guidelines. \\nThe framework stands on the shoulders of years of \\nresearch in South Africa on the just transition, done \\nby government, business, civil society, academia, and \\nlabour unions. The framework incorporates learnings \\nfrom prior consultation processes on the just transition, \\nincluding those facilitated by the National Planning \\nCommission (NPC 2019) and the National Economic \\nDevelopment and Labour Council (NEDLAC 2020). \\nThe framework complements international best practice \\nguidance on achieving just transitions (ILO 2015). The \\nframework also links with other just transition plans \\n'),\n",

As a result, the multiple \\nefforts by social partners to respond to the transition \\nare uneven and uncoordinated. The work done to \\nprepare this just transition framework—and indeed \\nthe framework itself—fills this gap. This framework \\nprovides a foundation for the government to adopt a \\nunifying national policy statement to guide work on \\nthe just transition.\\nWhat is the Scope of the Just \\nTransition Framework?\\nThe just transition framework is positioned at the nexus \\nof climate and development issues in South Africa. The \\nframework therefore supports South Africa’s broader \\nefforts to redesign the economy to the benefit of most \\ncitizens to enable deep, just, and transformational shifts \\n(i.e., addressing the triple challenges), in the context of \\ndelivering an effective response to climate change (i.e., \\nimproving resilience, making substantial cuts to green-\\nhouse gas emissions, and protecting and promoting the \\nhealth of communities). \\nThe framework does not deal with climate mitigation \\nand adaptation policies per se. Rather, the frame-\\nwork focuses on managing the social and economic \\nconsequences of those policies, while putting human \\ndevelopment concerns at the centre of decision-mak-\\ning. The framework also considers the alternative \\neconomic models that may be needed to enable a just \\ntransition (Albert 2020; Hickel et al. 2021; Fan-\\nning et al. 2022).\\nThe just transition framework is not exhaustive, nor a \\ndetailed implementation plan, but rather a first organ-\\nising frame to give effect to a just transition in South \\nAfrica. The PCC will continue to update the frame-\\nwork as new learnings and stakeholder consultations \\ntake place. The PCC will continue to engage with all \\nstakeholders, especially those most impacted, to ensure \\nthat their voices and experiences support a just transi-\\ntion in South Africa. The PCC will also work with all \\nsocial partners in developing a detailed implementation \\nplan for the just transition, building on existing policies \\nand initiatives.\\nWho is the Just Transition \\nFramework for?\\nThe just transition framework is for all social partners \\nin South Africa, across all sectors. There is, however, no \\n“one size fits all” approach to the just transition (ILO \\n2015). Social partners in South Africa will need to \\ndesign their own policies and programmes in line with \\ntheir specific conditions, responsibilities, and realms of \\ninfluence, based on the vision, principles, and interven-\\ntions articulated in this framework.

Women are particularly \\nvulnerable to the effects of climate change and other \\nforms of environmental degradation; solutions to \\nclimate change are documented to be more effective \\nwhen involving women (ILO 2021). At the same \\ntime, there should be a strong focus on South Africa’s \\nyouth, as well as workers that form part of the infor-\\nmal economy—empowering these groups to seize the \\nopportunities in the new green economy.\\nHow is the Just Transition  \\nFramework Organised?\\nThe just transition framework is organised in 7 main \\nsections (see Figure 1).\\n1. FOUNDATIONS FOR A JUST \\nTRANSITION FRAMEWORK\\nThe work on just transitions in South Africa dates back \\nmore than a decade, first originating with the labour \\nmovement. In 2009, at the tenth national congress, the \\nCongress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) \\nhighlighted the importance of a just transition to \\n“protect the most vulnerable from the effects of climate \\nchange” (COSATU 2009). COSATU built on this \\ndefinition in its 2011 climate change policy paper, \\nexplicitly calling for a just transition to a low-carbon \\neconomy, where the “just transition” focused on \\nmitigating transition impacts on working-class groups, \\nincluding workers, communities, and small businesses \\n(COSATU 2011). \\nThe focus on achieving a just transition soon followed \\nfrom national government. In 2011, the National Cli-\\nmate Change Response White Paper emphasised a just \\ntransition as a policy imperative and an essential part of \\nan effective climate change response (DEA 2011). In \\n2012, South Africa adopted a National Development \\nPlan (NDP) after an extensive consultation process, \\nwith a focus on environmental sustainability and chart-\\ning an equitable transition to a low-carbon economy \\n(NDP 2012). The NPC also engaged in social dia-\\nlogues between 2017 and 2019 on the just transition, \\nin all provinces and among a variety of stakeholders, \\nincluding the youth and energy-intensive users (NPC \\n2019). In December 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa \\nestablished the PCC (originally named the Presiden-\\ntial Climate Change Coordinating Commission), with \\nan explicit aim to “advise on and facilitate a common \\nunderstanding of a just transition, cognisant of the \\nsocio-economic, environmental and technological \\nimplications of climate change” (The Presidency 2020). \\nSouth Africa’s Draft Climate Change Act also includes \\nFigure 1 • South Africa’s Just Transition Framework \\n  \\n1.

For example, the Department of \\nForestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) was \\ninstrumental in creating the National Employment \\nVulnerability Assessment (Makgetla et al. 2019) and \\nSector Jobs Resilience Plans (Makgetla et al. 2020c); \\nthe Department of Mineral Resources and Energy \\n(DMRE) has engaged in several scoping studies and \\ndeveloped a draft just energy transition plan (DMRE \\n2020); National Treasury has created working groups \\nfocused on climate change and the just transition, \\nas well as deepened work on financing a sustainable \\neconomy (National Treasury 2021; National Treasury \\n2022). The Department of Trade, Industry and Com-\\npetition (dtic) has developed a roadmap for the local \\nproduction of electric vehicle and components in South \\nAfrica (dtic 2021); the Department of Public Enter-\\nprises (DPE) has developed a roadmap for Eskom as \\npart of a reformed electricity industry (DPE 2019).\\nThe just transition imperative has now been entrenched \\nand embraced by most major stakeholder groups in \\nSouth Africa. There is broad consensus among social \\npartners that climate change will impact people and \\nthe economy, and that a just transition to a sustainable, \\ncleaner, and more inclusive economy is required (PCC \\n2022b). All social partners are clear that a just transi-\\ntion should protect constituents, provide a reasonable \\nopportunity to work, and empower those that are most \\nimpacted (PCC 2022b). \\nThe just transition framework builds on and comple-\\nments these learnings and the perspectives of different \\nsocial partners.\\n2. DEFINING A JUST \\nTRANSITION FOR SOUTH  \\nAFRICA\\nThe framework is guided by a shared definition of a \\njust transition in South Africa. The definition builds \\non the work done by NEDLAC (NEDLAC 2019), \\nthe National Planning Commission (NPC 2020), the \\ndefinition articulated in the draft Climate Change Bill \\n(DFFE 2022), and the views expressed in the stake-\\nholder consultations and community engagements \\nfacilitated by the PCC (PCC 2022a; 2022b). \\nThe definition for a just transition, put forward in this \\nframework, is therefore as follows:\\nA just transition aims to achieve a quality life for \\nall South Africans, in the context of increasing the \\nability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate, \\nfostering climate resilience, and reaching net-zero \\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 2050, in line with best \\navailable science.\\nA just transition contributes to the goals of decent \\nwork for all, social inclusion, and the eradica-\\ntion of poverty.\\nA just transition puts people at the centre of deci-\\nsion making, especially those most impacted, the \\npoor, women, people with disabilities, and the \\nyouth—empowering and equipping them for new \\nopportunities of the future.\\nA just transition builds the resilience of the economy \\nand people through affordable, decentralised, diversely \\nowned renewable energy systems; conservation of nat-\\nural resources; equitable access of water resources; an \\nenvironment that is not harmful to one’s health and \\nwell-being; and sustainable, equitable, inclusive land-\\nuse for all, especially for the most vulnerable.\\n'),\n",

PRINCIPLES \\nThe Bill of Rights, set out in Chapter 2 of the South \\nAfrican Constitution, enshrines first generation demo-\\ncratic and political rights, along with second generation \\nsocio-economic rights (e.g., shelter, health care, food, \\nwater and social services) and third generation col-\\nlective development rights (e.g., environment and \\nsustainable development, rights to collective organi-\\nzation and economic activities, rights of cultural and \\nlinguistic communities). These rights are given further \\nexpression in Chapter 1 of the National Environment \\nManagement Act (Act 107 of 1998), which contains \\na justiciable set of principles including putting human \\ndevelopment concerns at the centre of decision making, \\nproducer and polluter responsibility, equitable access \\nto environmental resources, and equipping people to \\nparticipate in decision making. \\nIn building on these progressive principles, this frame-\\nwork advances three principles as underpinning a just \\ntransition towards an environmentally sustainable econ-\\nomy and society in South Africa: distributive justice, \\nrestorative justice, and procedural justice. These prin-\\nciples are drawn from literature on the just transition \\n(Cahill and Allen 2020; McCauley and Heffron 2018), \\nconsultations facilitated by the PCC (PCC 2022a, \\n2022b), and international best practice guidelines \\n(ILO 2015, 2021).\\nThe theme of environmental justice also underlies all \\nthese principles—increasing the resilience of people \\nand the environment to climate impacts.

AT-RISK VALUE CHAINS \\nAND SECTORS\\nAn effective just transition demands an understanding \\nof the working people and communities that are (1) \\nnegatively impacted by climate change i.e., when their \\nlives and livelihoods are directly impacted by droughts, \\nfloods, and other extreme weather events or other \\nlong-term climate impacts (e.g. food security risks, \\nwater scarcity) and/or (2) negatively impacted by the \\nsectoral shifts in response to climate change i.e., when \\ntheir means of securing income and work are tied to \\nhigh-emissions industries that are phased out over time. \\nThis framework begins by focusing on four sectors and \\nvalue chains that are at-risk in the transition, which \\nform part of the formal economy: (1) the coal value \\nchain, (2) the auto value chain, (3) agriculture, and \\n(4) tourism, as a first illustration of these risks. These \\nanalyses draw on earlier work done in preparing South \\nAfrica’s National Employment Vulnerability Assessment \\n(Makgetla et al. 2019) and Sector Jobs Resilience Plans \\n(Patel et al. 2020; Maseko et al. 2020; Makgetla et al. \\n2020a; Makgetla et al. 2020b) but are not exhaustive. \\nFurther work is required to examine the vulnerabilities \\nin other groups and sectors, as well as workers in South \\nAfrica’s informal economy. This work must include a \\nspatial lens—considering spatial disparity as an import-\\nant binding constraint in South Africa’s inclusive \\ndevelopment and resilience to shocks, including climate \\nshocks. South Africa’s spatial exclusion, rooted in the \\napartheid legacy (e.g., in the form of townships and \\ninformal settlements on marginal and vulnerable lands), \\ncontinue to disadvantage certain groups, undermining \\nboth the resilience of affected communities and the \\nurban dividend in South Africa’s development. \\nCoal Value Chain \\nThe coal value chain in South Africa faces one of the \\nearliest disruptions in the global transition towards \\nreaching net-zero emissions. Demand for coal for elec-\\ntricity and exports shrunk in the 2010s and is expected \\nto decline further in the long term as countries reduce \\ntheir greenhouse gas emissions (Patel et al. 2020). Pro-\\njections from the International Energy Agency show \\nan increase in global coal demand through 2024, and \\nthen plateauing. Coal consumption will need to decline \\nquickly and sharply thereafter to reach the goals of the \\nParis Agreement (IEA 2021). This will create signifi-\\ncant risks in South Africa, including revenue loss from \\nreduced coal exports; job losses across the coal value \\nchain; and loss of the economic ecosystems around coal \\nmining communities, potentially creating ghost towns \\nwithout effective economic diversification.\\nThe sector will also face risks from the impacts of \\nclimate change. Coal production requires a signifi-\\ncant amount of water, and climate change is likely to \\nincrease water scarcity and competition throughout \\nSouth Africa (Beukman and Reeler 2021). Min-\\ning operations for coal and other products are also \\nvulnerable to increased temperatures and extreme \\nweather events, so it is important for the transition \\nprocess to look at adaption pathways to reduce risk \\nalong the value chain and to communities in mining \\nareas (NBI 2021b).\\nDownstream users of coal—Eskom, Sasol (which \\nalso mines its own coal) and the electricity-intensive \\naluminium and ferro-alloys producers—can reduce \\nrisks to their operations and sustain their employment \\nif they develop alternative non-fossil fuel sources of \\nenergy and transition to new low-emissions production \\nmodels (Makgetla 2021b). In contrast, the coal mines, \\ntogether with their suppliers and communities, will \\nface downsizing from around 2025 (Makgetla 2021b). \\nThe challenge will be to enable them to transition their \\nbusiness operating models, as seamlessly as possible, \\nand for local and regional economies in these areas to \\ndesign development plans for growth, employment \\ncreation, and decent new livelihoods. \\nThe coal industry directly employed around 93,000 \\npeople in 2021 (Minerals Council South Africa 2022). \\nFrom the 1980s to early 2000s employment in the \\n'),\n",

Future pro-\\njections suggest declines, driven externally by reduced \\nglobal demand for South African coal exports, poten-\\ntially exacerbated by domestic trends to automation \\nand the digital economy (Strambo et al. 2019; Mak-\\ngetla 2021b). Most miners have matric qualifications \\nyet earn around 50 percent more than the median for \\nthe formal sector. This makes it harder to find equiva-\\nlent livelihoods outside of mining (Makgetla 2021b). \\nCoal production is geographically concentrated with 80 \\npercent occurring in Mpumalanga and over 70 percent \\nof South Africa’s total value added from coal coming \\nfrom just four towns— eMalahleni (Witbank), Steve \\nTshwete (Middelburg), Govan Mbeki and Msuka-\\nligwa (Ermelo) (Patel et al. 2020; Makgetla 2021b). \\nAround 1.1 million people live in these districts (Stats \\nSA 2011). Besides the direct employment effects, the \\ndownsizing in coal will affect a range of businesses and \\ninformal sector work that support the mines’ labour \\nforce. Moreover, the municipalities depend on Eskom \\nand the mines to provide some infrastructure and ser-\\nvices (Patel et al. 2020). \\nWith appropriate planning and support, some of the \\njob losses in the coal value chain can be offset by \\nfurther development of the domestic renewable energy \\nmanufacturing industry. The Draft South African \\nRenewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM) outlines some \\nof the potential benefits that can be realized by indus-\\ntrialising the renewable energy value chain, including \\ntargeted job creation in areas where former coal sector \\nemployees live (DMRE, dtic and DSI 2022). As the \\nSAREM is aligned with the Integrated Resource \\nPlan (IRP), any updates to the IRP that increase the \\nrenewable energy targets for 2030 or beyond would \\nlikely result in increases to the projected job and GDP \\ngrowth potential of the plan. \\nAuto Value Chain \\nThe auto industry depends on exports to Europe and \\nthe United States, which have committed to accelerat-\\ning the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) (Maseko \\net al. 2020; European Parliament 2022; The White \\nHouse 2021). If the South African auto industry does \\nnot keep up with this global transition, local producers \\nrisk exclusion from these crucial markets. Production of \\nEVs, however, requires far fewer inputs and jobs than \\npetroleum-based cars, though jobs may be created to \\ndevelop the infrastructure for charging stations, as well \\nas the activities flowing from battery management (e.g., \\nsafe disposal, recycling, and refurbishment) (Maseko et \\nal. 2020). The timeframes for the transition away from \\npetroleum-based transport depend largely on devel-\\nopments in the global North and, to a lesser extent, \\nregional markets. Europe and the United States have \\ncommitted to mass use of EVs by 2030 (European Par-\\nliament 2022; The White House 2021). A reduction \\nin demand for petrol and diesel will also have knock-on \\nimpacts for the liquid fuels sector.\\nCurrently, around 100,000 people work in auto manu-\\nfacturing (Maseko et al. 2020). The industry centres on \\nTshwane, eThekwini, Nelson Mandela Bay and Buffalo \\nCity (Maseko et al. 2020). The Eastern Cape could \\nface particularly harsh outcomes unless the province is \\nable to develop alternative production clusters (Maseko \\net al. 2020). The largest employment impacts will be \\nin support industries rather than auto production itself. \\nAround 250,000 people work as auto mechanics, over \\na third in the informal sector (Maseko et al. 2020). \\nInformal mechanics are predominantly self-employed. \\nAn additional 250,000 people are taxi owners and driv-\\ners; this group will face growing pressure to procure \\nnew e-vehicles, however, most will not be able to afford \\nthe investment without some form of state support \\n(Maseko et al. 2020). It is not yet clear how petrol \\nstations will adapt. They make much of their profits \\non retail sales but rely on petrol to attract customers \\n(Makgetla et al. 2019).

Agriculture has \\nalready begun to experience the impacts of increasingly \\nvolatile weather, with ever-deeper fluctuations in pro-\\nduction through the 2010s (DFFE 2019). The sector \\nhas faced persistent droughts in some areas; shifts in \\nseasonal rainfall; intense rainfalls, which caused floods \\nand, especially in labour-sending regions, worsened \\nerosion; and generally higher temperatures and humid-\\nity, affecting farmworkers, affecting animals and crops \\ndirectly, as well as incubating new pests and increas-\\ning water demand (DFFE 2019). These trends will \\nintensify over the coming years. Climate change is also \\nlikely to create permanent changes in the suitability of \\nregions to produce different crops in South Africa.\\nClimate-induced changes in water availability are likely \\nto have the most immediate and significant impact on \\nthe sector. Agriculture accounts for over sixty per-\\ncent of all water usage in South Africa (Beukman and \\nReeler 2021). The extent to which farmers can more \\nefficiently use water and adopt other climate adaptive \\npractices and technologies will significantly influence \\nimpacts on the sector. Commercial farmers have begun \\nto invest in more resilient infrastructure and crops, \\nsuch as shade for orchards, drip irrigation and heat-re-\\nsistant varieties (Chisoro-Dube and Roberts 2021). \\nMany smallholder farmers, however, lack the resources \\nto invest in climate-smart approaches without support \\nfrom the government or financial incentive schemes \\n(Beukman and Reeler 2021).\\nThe difference in adaptive capacity between commercial \\nand smallholder farmers is representative of the power \\ndynamics in the sector. The agricultural value chain is \\nhighly concentrated, with relatively few agro-indus-\\ntrial farms producing most products; roughly 50,000 \\nindustrial farms were responsible for over 90 percent of \\nagricultural products sold in formal retail outlets in the \\n2010s and around 70 percent of all agricultural income \\nis earned by less than 7 percent of farms (Makgetla et \\nal. 2020a; NBI 2021a). Labour force surveys sug-\\ngest that around a quarter of formal farm owners are \\nblack and black farmers account for just five person of \\nwater use (Makgetla et al. 2020a; Beukman and Reeler \\n2021). Addressing these existing inequalities within the \\nsector must be considered as part of the just transition.  \\nFarmworkers typically have less education (only 15 \\npercent have matric), lower pay, and fewer assets \\nthan other formal employees (Makgetla et al. 2019). \\nMoreover, they often live on isolated settlements on \\nfarms, making it harder for them to organise or to find \\nnew livelihoods. Under 5 percent are union mem-\\nbers (Makgetla et al. 2019). Because droughts affect \\nseasonal workers (around half of the total) particularly \\nseverely, it proves difficult to track their employment \\neffects (Makgetla et al. 2019). The outcomes appear, \\nnot as retrenchments, but as a failure to hire temporary \\nworkers, which farmers do not have to report.  \\nMedian earnings for farmworkers came to R2,500 \\na month for women in 2017, and R2,800 for men. \\nFor other formal employees, the median earnings for \\nwomen were R4,000 a month, and R5,000 for men \\n(Makgetla et al. 2019). The median woman farm-\\nworker earned a little over half than her counterpart in \\nother formal industries, while the median man earned \\n63 percent. The gender pay gap in farming, while \\napparent, is lower than in the rest of the economy \\n(Makgetla et al. 2019). \\n'),\n",

There will also be increasing domestic and \\ninternational demand for more climate resilient \\nagriculture, infrastructure, and housing, and for \\ncleaner transport. \\n• As the transition accelerates in the period 2025-\\n2030, very rapid investment will take place in new \\ntransmission lines and technologies for power \\ngeneration and storage. More reliable and cheaper \\nelectricity will promote a more sustainable economy \\nand job creation, while there will be growing inter-\\nnational and domestic markets for e-vehicles and \\nother technologies to reduce emissions and improve \\nresilience, which South Africa is well placed to \\nrespond to. Investments will seek to diversify econ-\\nomies in coal-dependent communities, and there is \\nthe prospect of greater urban densification which \\nreduces commuter and labour costs and increases \\nhousing demand, thus creating new economies. \\n• Beyond 2030, there will be a more affordable and \\nreliable electricity system, and other innovative \\ninvestments which lay the basis for a more dynamic, \\ndiversified, and equitable economy. Renewable \\nenergy production will make electricity cheaper and \\nmore dependable and will create new manufactur-\\ning and maintenance jobs.

The clean energy transition will also \\nopen new markets for the supply of other minerals, \\nlike platinum, vanadium, cobalt, copper, manganese, \\nand lithium, opening new export opportunities. Cli-\\nmate-smart agriculture could create better yields and \\nmore resilient crops, improving food security and \\nthe lives and livelihoods of small-scale farmers.\\nClear and determined governance responses are nec-\\nessary to seize these opportunities and support a just \\ntransition. Over the next five years, systems must be \\nestablished to ensure consistent and vigorous responses \\nto climate change across the state while building \\npartnerships with stakeholders, with clear mandates \\nand monitoring systems.

State capture, the loss of capable managers, ero-\\nsion of accountability, and lack of professionalism, has \\nseverely hampered the ability of the state to implement \\ngood governance at all tiers (The Presidency 2022).\\nEffective governance at the national, provincial, and \\nmunicipal levels will therefore be central to achieving \\na just and equitable transition in South Africa—\\nimplementing plans, building consensus, mobilising \\nresources (importantly, avoiding decisions/ investments \\nthat are not aligned with the just transition), coordi-\\nnating implementation, and monitoring progress. The \\nnature of climate risks and the urgency of the transition \\nis such that stakeholders must work intentionally, in \\nconcert. Mainstreaming the just transition imperative \\nin planning and budgeting is a crosscutting issue that \\nrequires a whole-of-government response.\\nEffective governance also requires far-sighted think-\\ning, with due consideration of the imperatives of a \\njust transition. Existing processes are mostly weighted \\ntoward short-run and immediate effects on workers and \\nbusinesses. These processes often do not pay sufficient \\nattention to the long-run economic and environmental \\ndamage done by high emissions and out-dated tech-\\nnologies. It follows that any decision with a substantial \\nlong-range economic impact, especially around energy, \\ninfrastructure, and new economic activities, must con-\\nsider the implications for the just transition.\\nNational Government\\nNational government has a crucial leadership and pol-\\nicy role to play in implementing the just transition. The \\njust transition policy imperative (and this framework) \\nshould be located within the central planning system of \\ngovernment, specifically in the National Development \\nPlan, the Medium- Term Strategic Framework, Annual \\nPerformance Plans, and annual budgeting processes. \\nEach government department should be encouraged to \\ndefine their roles in relation to these objectives.

FINANCE FOR A JUST \\nTRANSITION\\nAchieving a just transition in South Africa will require \\nsignificant capital mobilisation, from both public and \\nprivate sources, both domestically and internationally. \\nIt is estimated that South Africa will require at least \\nUS$250 billion over the next three decades to trans-\\nform the energy system, with at least US$10 billion \\nallocated toward “climate justice outcomes”—the heart \\nof the transition—to support workers and communities \\nin the transition e.g., compensation, retraining, relo-\\ncation, and rehabilitation of regions and communities \\n(Blended Finance Taskforce & Centre for Sustainabil-\\nity Transitions 2022). The estimated US$250 billion \\nexcludes the additional requirements to transition to a \\nfully green economy, including strengthened adapta-\\ntion measures (Blended Finance Taskforce & Centre \\nfor Sustainability Transitions 2022).\\nDomestically, capital can be mobilised by strengthening \\nregulation and institutional arrangements, partnerships \\nbetween the public and private sector for delivery, \\nand attracting capital into new markets, technologies, \\nbusiness models, and enterprises (including small- \\nand medium-sized enterprises). Historically, around \\nthree-quarters of South Africa’s climate finance flows \\n(public and private) have been allocated to clean energy \\ngeneration projects, which has largely been a function \\nof the commercial maturity of the renewable energy \\nsector, spearheaded by the Renewable Energy Inde-\\npendent Power Producers Procurement Programme. \\nNational Treasury has a key leading role to play in \\nincorporating climate considerations and the just transi-\\ntion imperative into national financing and budgeting, \\nto ensure alignment with national objectives. National \\nTreasury has already created working groups focused \\non climate change and the just transition, as well as \\ndeepened work on financing a sustainable economy, \\namong other activities (National Treasury 2021; \\nNational Treasury 2022).\\nInternationally, capital can be mobilised through the \\nprovisions of the Paris Agreement, among others, \\nwhere developed countries are required to provide \\nsupport to developing countries in reaching their \\nclimate goals.

These engagements have been \\nexceptionally fruitful, with stakeholders interested and \\nengaged—fertile ground for a compact to form over \\ntime. The major economic, social, and environmental \\ndecisions required for a just transition require social \\npartners to forge a consensus around the transition. \\nThe just energy transition, in particular, needs part-\\nners to agree around the pace of decarbonization, the \\nscaling up of low carbon energy and the value chains \\nthat support it, the upgrading of the energy grid and \\nthe mobilization of climate finance, at scale, to enable a \\njust transition. \\nFurther work, in consultation with all social partners, \\nis required to develop a detailed just transition imple-\\nmentation plan, with this document as the guiding \\nframe. Such an implementation plan must have asso-\\nciated timelines and sufficient budget allocation to \\nhave credibility and a high chance of success. The PCC \\nwill continue to play a key role in supporting efforts \\nto form a social compact around the just transition, \\nundertaking evidence-based research and bringing \\ntogether all stakeholders in constructive dialogue to \\ndefine future development pathways, considering the \\nrisks and opportunities posed by a changing climate.

Approach and Methodology \\n \\nA rapid assessment of the target locations for the stakeholder engagement was \\ncarried out to identify issues that will be relevant to discussions consensus on the just \\ntransition (e.g., mine closures, environmental degradation, food and water security, \\nunemployment, poverty, and alternative livelihood opportunities).  \\n \\nStakeholder mapping was undertaken to identify key stakeholders who represent \\nthe affected communities. This included local community members, community \\nrepresentatives (e.g., forums, associations, councillors, youth and women groups \\nand leaders, etc.), NGOs and other community-based organisations, as well as \\nrelevant district, regional or national government representatives. Care was taken \\nwith the stakeholder mapping to ensure that the community voices were well \\nrepresented, with no single stakeholder group dominating a dialogue.  \\n \\nOneWorld sought guidance from the PCC and relevant Commissioners to support \\nthe stakeholder mapping process and ensure the identification of the right \\nstakeholders to achieve the necessary depth of community reach and \\nrepresentation.  \\n \\nFigure 2 presents the representation of stakeholder groups to ensure a balance \\nbetween representatives from government, business, and community groups. \\n \\nFigure 2. Balanced Representation of Stakeholder Groups \\n \\n \\nSite visits were undertaken to consult and engage with key (pre-identified) local \\nstakeholders; to publicise and communicate around the upcoming engagement, \\nget buy-in; consult with stakeholders regarding identification of other/additional \\nstakeholders not previously identified; and get consensus on the agenda for the \\nengagement, including possible workshop hosting venues, etc. The outcomes of the \\nsite visits, in addition to the key insights from each of the community workshops, are \\ndiscussed in more detail in the following sections. \\n \\n  \\n'),\n",

Overall Messages Emerging from the Community Engagements \\n \\nSeveral trends and themes emerged from the community engagements: \\n \\nCommunities understand the negative impacts of climate change. There is \\nwidespread acceptance that greenhouse gases and local emissions must be \\nreduced. The impacts of climate change, such as more frequent and intense \\nweather events, are also generally well understood. Communities, however, lack a \\nclear understanding of the dynamics and details of what it means to achieve a just \\ntransition to a low carbon and climate resilient society.  \\n \\nCommunities are willing to engage in and support a just transition but only if they are \\nintegral to the decision-making process. Communities want a say in their future and \\nan inclusive role in making that future happen. Many community members \\nexpressed the need to be empowered through a seat at the decision table and to \\nhave ownership of the process of the transition. \\n \\nCommunities are willing to support a just transition, but they want to see meaningful \\neconomic benefit arising from its implementation. Not all communities want \\nhandouts or social grants development. Members want relevant and meaningful \\nskills, appropriate to alternative development pathways in the transition, as well as \\naccess to ways to produce goods or services as the transition is taking place. \\n \\nCommunities expressed significant health concerns relating to the extraction and \\ncombustion of fossil fuels. All fossil fuel-based community cited significant health \\nimpacts because of local mining, energy operations and oil refining operations, \\nparticularly in respect of respiratory issues. Communities also lack access to \\nadequate and affordable healthcare; members are calling for reparations and \\naccess to affordable and effective health services. Communities also calling for the \\nclosure of coal mines and oil refineries and the installation of clean technologies as \\na means of mitigating negative health impacts. \\n \\nWater is understood to be significantly affected by climate change. Poor basic water \\nservice delivery and low maintenance of water systems is being exacerbated by \\nclimate change as well as by contamination from the mining and energy industry, \\nfor example through acid mine drainage (AMD) from unrehabilitated coal mine \\ndumps. Communities clearly make the link between mining and water pollution. \\n \\nThe just transition is a complex and nuanced discussion around trade-offs perceived \\nbetween development and climate change. Communities and individual \\nstakeholders are concerned about the negative health and environmental impacts \\nof mining and energy, but also concerned about the potential for job losses. The \\ncoal/oil value chain underpins livelihoods in many of these areas. If mines and \\npower stations are shut down, then local livelihoods will be lost. There is little \\nindication/confidence in the government’s ability to manage the transition to a low \\ncarbon and climate resilient society to provide viable and timely alternatives. \\n '),\n",

Most community members who \\nare responsible for the future of their children are very concerned about health \\nimpacts and unsustainable social effects of coal.  \\n \\nThe youth and those without children are deeply concerned about their need to \\nsecure future jobs for themselves. They plead for some form of clean technology as \\na means of ameliorating the impact of coal rather than phasing it out, or even \\nkeeping coal mining alive for as long as the resource is available in South Africa.  \\n \\nCommunities are combining the pain of climate change impacts with their \\nexperience of poor basic service delivery and governance. A successful just \\ntransition will therefore depend on integrated efforts to address the just transition \\nand poor local government service delivery and governance across all spheres of \\ngovernment.  \\n \\nLack of government engagement. The government is widely seen as being \\nunresponsive and negligent in its engagement with communities, or in responding to \\ntheir concerns. For example, one national union made a submission to government \\nin 2017 regarding options for reducing pollution from power plants and have not \\nseen a response to date. This lack of action on the side of government may hamper \\nthe just transition dialogue and implementation process.  \\n \\nTrust needs to be built with communities. Communities are universal in their demands \\nfor an early return date, regular engagements, and tangible outcomes from these \\nengagements. Communities are frustrated by the low presence of national \\ngovernment and unkept promises of jobs and inclusive service delivery. The PCC is \\nperceived as bringing welcome change in this regard, but trust still needs to be \\nsecured and sustained. Frustration and anger around low/no delivery against \\ngovernment promises is palpable in every community engaged. \\n \\nDistrust in government is largely a result of corruption and poor governance. \\nCommunities are questioning how a just transition can be effectively implemented \\nby a government that concomitantly does not seem to care nor effectively regulate \\nitself.  \\n \\nInclusive land use and access is seen as a significant factor in the just transition. \\nEffective and ongoing rehabilitation (during and post mining operations) of affected \\nland and areas is widely called for, with an emphasis on involving community-based \\nenterprises in rehabilitation opportunities. This is seen as a significant small business \\nand employment opportunity across mining affected areas in South Africa. \\nCommunities demand that the department responsible for mining and energy \\nenforce its regulations and act according to its mandate.  \\n \\nEconomic stability. Mining is perceived as currently important for creating jobs, \\nenterprise opportunities and economic stability. However, many communities \\nbelieve that currently they do not sufficiently directly benefit from these \\nopportunities and that these opportunities do not make up for the negative impacts. '),\n",

There is a \\nneed for empirical evidence for moving away from coal and for how to transition to \\nlow emission vehicles. Evidence on the most effective way the motor industry in \\nSouth Africa should participate in the global electric vehicle (EV) transition is not \\navailable, and it remains unclear as to how many jobs will be lost through phasing \\ndown/out coal and when, and where the major uptake of lost jobs will lie.  \\n \\nRenewable energy is often misunderstood. Several community representatives \\nexpressed misinformation and a lack of understanding of the costs of, resources for, \\nand contribution of renewable energy to the just transition to a low carbon and \\nclimate resilient future in South Africa. Some communities perceive renewable \\nenergy as being too expensive, while others are concerned that renewable energy \\ndevelopments will not create sufficient jobs and enterprise opportunities to absorb \\ncoal phase down/out losses.  \\n \\nGatekeepers protect mining interests. Within every community there are those who \\nare employed in the mining sector and resort to violence to protect their interests. \\nEnvironmental and gender activists are routinely targeted. There is no evidence that \\nthe government is protecting the interests of communities in this regard. This is \\ncreating the impression amongst communities that government is complicit in this \\ngatekeeping and attacks on activists, and is a dominant interpretation that people \\nare drawing. Along with this interpretation is the thus far unshakeable perception \\nthat the PCC, as a perceived arm of government, is paying lip service to the just \\ntransition while protecting its own interests. \\n \\nSkills and capacity gaps. There are serious skills development/capacity \\ndevelopment concerns amongst all communities. They are calling for access to \\ntraining and reskilling, but it must be fit for purpose. If migration away from fossil fuels \\nto more sustainable industries is what is required, then the communities directly \\naffected by/engaged in the fossil fuel operations should be placed up front for \\nreskilling. These communities should also be at the forefront of leading the \\nrepurposing and/or decommissioning of these operations. In other examples, such \\nas Gqeberha, where the motor industry creates around 10,000 jobs, a potential \\nindustrial shift to EVs necessitates that skills development is essential, to effectively \\nparticipate in the opportunities of the future (e.g., battery storage pack \\nmanufacture).  \\n \\nLanguage and accessibility. Communities experience various forms of climate \\nchange impacts, and they frame them in their own way. The just transition dialogue \\nneeds to consider the language and forms of communication in the way people are \\nengaged with, and how communities communicate their knowledge/experiences \\nof climate change. This also speaks to the need for integration of indigenous \\nknowledge and on the ground experiences of the effects of climate change, such '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='9 \\n \\nas for rainfall and agriculture. It is essential to create a space for civil society to \\nframe the challenges they are facing and collaborate in developing solutions. \\n \\nYouth inclusion. For the most part, most of the youth feel excluded from decision-\\nmaking and implementation. There is a large gap that needs to be bridged in terms \\nof inclusivity with the youth across South Africa. Proposed solutions and \\nimplementation resource requirements must mirror the size of the gap to be bridged. \\nFor example, most youth are participating at the micro enterprise level, and \\nresource assistance in the transition needs to be appropriately crafted.  \\n \\nRacial dynamics. Racial divisions and dynamics such as spatial development \\nplanning as a legacy of the apartheid era is evident in all communities, in \\ndifferentiated ways.  \\n \\nPositioning the just transition. There is a lack of clarity as to the positioning of the just \\ntransition process within the provincial and district structures of South Africa. The \\nmainstreaming of the just transition process within existing provincial, district and \\nlocal governance frameworks needs to be urgently addressed to ensure coherent \\ncommunication and action. Anchoring the just transition dialogue process in the \\noffice of the Premier of a high impacted province such as Mpumalanga, and using \\nthe district model to implement the dialogue, could be more effective than the \\ncurrent process. However, the most suitable approach is likely to be one that aligns \\nwith the District Development Model in which the President vests significant hope for \\nenergising South Africa’s cooperative governance and for improving municipalities.  \\n \\nCommunities have solutions in mind. It is clear from the site visits and the workshops \\nthat communities have their own ideas for how the just transition, or elements \\nthereof, can be achieved in their local context. Local colleges offering skills \\ndevelopment for fit-for-purpose skills development are essential vehicles for reskilling \\ncommunities. Many communities have recommended that climate change and the \\njust transition be integrated into school and tertiary education curricula. \\n \\nFinancial support for local actors. There are several local actors already working with \\ncommunities on climate change and the just transition across the country. The \\nquestion therefore becomes: “Is it possible to leverage financial support for these \\nactors as partners in and champions of the just transition?” \\n \\nGender-responsive interventions: Women are often at the forefront of adapting to \\nclimate change and economic shifts. The just transition needs to have gender-\\nfocussed interventions and a clear understanding of the gender issues on the \\nground in these communities. With this, women need to be equally empowered as \\nmen for jobs and pay in the just transition, this is seen as a critical means of \\ncombatting gender-based violence.  \\n \\nMobilisation takes time. This process must build in sufficient time and space for \\nstakeholders to prepare themselves to engage effectively. Additional engagement \\nis required to build a basis from which stakeholders can engage effectively with the \\njust transition process. '),\n",

Overall Messages from Impacted Sectors \\n \\nKey observations from impacted sectors are captured below, set against a series of \\nthemes that underpinned the selection of community engagement sites: the coal \\nvalue chain, the auto value chain, agriculture, and tourism. \\n \\n4.1. Coal Value Chain  \\n \\nThe three project sites in Mpumalanga (Carolina, Emalahleni and Secunda) and the \\nLimpopo site (Lephalale) were focused on coal mining and coal-based energy \\nproduction industries, and therefore on the global climate change response to \\nphase out fossil fuels.  \\n \\nThe following observations arose from participants in site visits and workshops:  \\n▪ Coal phase-down is perceived as more realistic than immediate phase-out, and \\nthere are some sections within communities that prefer to find ways of \\nmaintaining coal mining and energy production while also reducing emissions. \\n▪ Many community members called for technologies, such as clean production \\ntechnologies, to reduce the impacts of coal, to enable prolonging the extraction \\nof coal. \\n▪ Across all sites with poor air quality, there are calls for reparations and cleaner \\ntechnologies and/or phase out of coal to mitigate the severe health impacts of \\ncoal mining and coal-based energy production. \\n▪ Careful mapping of coal value chains should take place to ensure that the \\nproposed alternative value chains offer tangible opportunities for communities. \\n▪ More transparency and effective monitoring of regulations is needed in the coal \\nmining and energy sector.  \\n▪ There is a significant need to increase the understanding of the affordability and \\nreliability of energy generation alternatives such as renewable energy, as \\ncommunity members lacked sufficient knowledge about the real dynamics, \\nfacts, and opportunities of the renewable energy industry.  \\n \\n4.2. Auto Value Chain  \\n \\nThe Eastern Cape site, Gqeberha, is home to a significant component of South \\nAfrica’s automotive industry, which is supported by the Motor Industry Development \\nPlan (MIDP) and employs approximately 110,000 people across vehicle and \\ncomponent manufacturers.  \\n \\nGlobally, the industry is in transition away from manufacturing high-emitting internal \\ncombustion engines toward electric vehicles (EVs). Europe, South Africa’s primary \\nvehicle export market, recently proposed legislated targets that will cut emissions \\nfrom cars by 55 percent by 2030, and to zero emissions from cars by 2035 (EU, 2035). \\nA significant increase in the uptake of EVs will be needed to achieve these targets, \\nand South African manufacturers would need to gear up for EV exports to retain its \\nmarket share in Europe—critical to sustaining the industry in South Africa.  \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='11 \\n \\nThe following observations arose from participants in site visits and workshops:  \\n▪ The domestic market for EVs is shrinking. There has been a decline in local \\ndemand since 2014, concomitant with low economic growth and a shrinking \\nmiddle class where the demand for cars lies.  \\n▪ The auto export market is a mainstay of the South African automotive \\nmanufacturing industry. With this, European exports dominate.  \\n▪ The auto industry incentive scheme requires a balance between domestic \\nmarket production and exports. It is not a purely or primarily an export industry.  \\n▪ The domestic market is likely to move into hybrid vehicles which demands a \\ndifferent production process from a purely internal combustion unit industry.  \\n▪ The South African motor industry is unlikely to survive the transition to zero emission \\nvehicles if it does not produce and export EVs and hybrid vehicles. \\n▪ Experts and analysts believe that South Africa will not be able to competitively \\nproduce battery packs, limiting the locally manufactured components of EVs. \\n▪ The small business community and some economic development officials in the \\nNelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality have a contradictory view and \\nbelieve that South Africa can compete effectively and has the expertise and \\nskills to do so. \\n▪ The motor industry (VWSA) and the Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber \\nconfirm the risk of not manufacturing EVs for the export market and are \\nconcerned about the uptake of EVs in the local market in the absence of \\ngovernment incentives that would increase the affordability and therefore the \\naccessibility of EVs in the domestic portion of their market. \\n \\n4.3. Agriculture \\n \\nAgriculture is an important land use that many South Africans rely on for their \\nlivelihoods and food security. It is also a land use that competes with mining. \\n \\nThe following observations arose from participants in site visits and workshops:  \\n▪ Agriculture cannot absorb all the jobs lost through the phase-out/down of coal \\nand other industries, such as renewable energy, and in some areas tourism, \\nwould be needed to supplement job replacement opportunities. \\n▪ Agriculture is under threat by coal (and other mining activities) largely because \\nof degraded land that in the main, is not being rehabilitated by the mining \\nindustry, and because of water pollution and serious water contamination, the \\nlatter from Acid Mine Drainage (AMD).  \\n▪ Water security is further threatened by poor maintenance and by climate \\nchange impacts. \\n▪ The Department for Minerals and Energy is issuing mining permits without \\nconsidering the agriculture (and health) impacts of mining activities and is not \\nenforcing regulations that require miners to mitigate these impacts. \\n▪ Some communities prefer to maintain the quality of their agriculture land rather \\nthan allow mining activities to reduce fertility, with many seeing mining as \\nsomething that both detracts from more sustainable activities such as agriculture \\nand does not bring sufficient direct benefits to local communities. \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='12 \\n \\n4.4. Tourism  \\n \\nTourism, although not a major feature of these community engagements, featured \\nas an alternative to high polluting economic activities and as an opportunity for \\nincreasing jobs and enterprise development opportunities.  \\n \\nThe following observations arose from participants in site visits and workshops:  \\n▪ The Xolobeni community members that were vocal in the Imbizo in this site \\nconsider tourism development as a preferable alternative to the mining activities \\nthat have been proposed for the area.  \\n▪ Many communities consider mining and poor air quality as a deterrent to tourism. \\n▪ Some Youth representatives perceive small business opportunities in tourism but \\nneed government support to enable this. \\n \\n5. Overall Messages from Communities \\n \\nCross cutting community messages and observations from the community \\nengagements emerged that must be considered in planning for a just transition: \\n▪ Skills exist within communities and skills development for various transitions must \\nbe supported by government and industry. \\n▪ Small business opportunities are often preferable to jobs in large companies, \\nnoting that many communities believe they have not sufficiently directly \\nbenefitted from the opportunities in large industrial developments. \\n▪ It is mainly the youth that perceive that their main job opportunities lie in large \\nindustry and in mining, whereas more seasoned community members, \\nparticularly parents and those looking after the aged, are more concerned with \\nhealth issues and longer-term sustainability of, for example land that can yield \\nlonger term and healthier livelihoods.  \\n▪ Skilling and empowering youth to drive the just transition will be critical. The youth \\nare disadvantaged in skills and experience requirements to enter the job market.  \\n▪ Communities wish to be part of the just transition decision making and \\nimplementation process and wish to be empowered to participate in and \\nsupport the transition effectively.  \\n▪ Communities across the board strongly expressed the concern that the PCC \\nwon’t come back after this process with an implementable plan that is owned \\nby and benefits their communities. \\n▪ Communities are not necessarily anti-development, rather they are against \\ndevelopment that does not address their needs; is inappropriate for the local \\ncontext; and which does not deliver tangible benefits. \\n▪ Women should be empowered and involved in planning for the just transition \\nand should have equal job and pay opportunities as men. This is a means for \\nthem to addressing gender-based violence that is prevalent in many parts of the \\ncountry.  \\n▪ Poor basic service delivery and inequitable access to economic opportunities \\nand social services such as health care, will hamper the just transition. Without \\nrectification of these issues, the transition cannot take place in a just manner.  \\n '),\n",

It forms part of the western regions of the province and borders \\nonto the Gauteng Province. The municipality is strategically located in terms of the \\nprovincial context and transport network given its proximity to the three Gauteng \\nMetropolitan Municipalities and the transport routes that connect Gauteng and \\neMalahleni with Mbombela, the provincial capital and a key gateway to one of \\nSouth Africa’s major tourist attractions, the Kruger National Park, and ultimately \\nMaputo in Mozambique.  \\n \\nThe southern areas of the eMalahleni Municipality form part of the region referred to \\nas the Energy Mecca of South Africa, due to its rich deposits of coal reserves and \\npower stations. eMalahleni and Middelburg (situated in the adjacent Steve Tshwete \\nMunicipality) are the highest order settlements in the Nkangala District. These towns \\noffer the full spectrum of business and social activities, and both towns have large \\nindustrial areas. The towns fulfil the function of service centres to the smaller towns \\nand settlements, as well as farms in the district. \\n \\nCoal is a fossil fuel, the use of which is one of the main drivers of excess greenhouse \\ngases in the atmosphere which are the root cause of global warming and the \\nconsequent global climate change crisis. Coal-based energy generation is also \\ncentral to South Africa’s contributions to global carbon emissions, while the country \\nhas, alongside the global community, embarked on a transition to diversifying its \\nenergy base away from coal toward alternate energy sources, including renewable \\nenergy sources such as solar and wind.    \\n \\neMalahleni is among the municipalities in Mpumalanga that is in a coal transition, \\naffecting both its coal mining and energy production. This places the municipality \\nand its surrounds at the heart of the just transition questions facing South African \\nsociety, such as: what will happen to coal-based jobs, skills, and livelihoods, and \\nwhat are the opportunities for alternate job and livelihood pathways arising from the \\ntransition?    \\n \\nFor these, and perhaps other reasons, eMalahleni is one of the eight sights \\nrepresentative of the just transition issues facing South Africa. The workshop is \\ndesigned to elicit community voices, drawn from across society, on the fears and \\nopportunities facing eMalahleni and to consider the key pathways and tangible \\nactions believed necessary to ensure a positive and inclusive outcome from the \\ncoal transition.  \\n \\nLocal perspectives \\n \\nIn this site, key learnings arose from both a provincial and a municipality perspective.  \\n '),\n",

Coal got the province through COVID and is \\nthe main source of GDP. Therefore, there is a pivotal need to balance the need \\nfor survival and jobs with the just transition. With this, one of the biggest perceived \\ngaps is that case studies or demonstration sites are not available to prove that \\nthe alternatives proposed under the just transition are viable for communities \\n(notably, such benchmarks are not readily available from elsewhere in the world \\nyet either). \\n▪ Mpumalanga wants to provide a forum for provincial-led discussion on the coal \\ntransition it faces. In particular, the province needs to demonstrate concrete and \\ntangible impacts to ensure uptake by communities. \\n▪ Consensus on the way forward for a just transition has not been reached at the \\nprovincial level, yet clear action and follow through on tangible solutions is both \\nneeded and desired.  \\n▪ Engagement fatigue is prevalent, primarily because stakeholders do not always \\nfeel heard in these engagements and feel that engagements seldom yield \\ntangible outcomes.  \\n \\neMalahleni perspective \\n▪ There is a lack of understanding on climate change impacts and what the just \\ntransition is. At the same time, there is a need for accessible community \\nlanguage (practical and relevant examples are good) as well as evidence \\ncollection and knowledge management. \\n▪ Training will be needed, and a training-of-the-trainers model was proposed, \\npreferably ahead of the workshops to ensure that communities are sensitised, \\nand community voices are captured. \\n▪ Women are already undertaking green activities by necessity, with women likely \\nplaying a key role in the just transition; therefore their voice is very important. \\n▪ There is a perception that both the mines and government are not engaging \\nmeaningfully with communities, and that the negative impacts of mining (e.g., \\nwater and health) are not taken seriously. \\n▪ Communities are worried about the future and their survival. There are practical \\nconcerns around jobs, and access to basic services such as water. \\n▪ Communities cannot afford the current energy tariffs and want certainty that \\nfuture energy tariffs from renewable sources will be affordable, e.g., need \\nbattery storage so could the costs of batteries be subsidised?  \\n▪ There is a section of the population employed by the mines and are vigorous in \\ntheir defence of the mines. This is driven largely by concern for their income, \\nwhile it also has the potential to divide communities and block consensus on the \\npathways toward a just transition. \\n▪ Inclusivity is a major challenge. \\n▪ Engaging the youth is difficult and therefore can be easily done wrong. \\n▪ If youth don’t see the benefit for themselves in the transition, they will not \\nengage. If they don’t engage, they will not be part of the solution. At the same '),\n",

With this, \\nyouth (among other stakeholder groups) need life and technical skills training, \\nwhile schools outreach initiatives will be important for raising awareness, \\nsensitising communities, and ensuring a stronger foundation for the just transition \\nin the future.  \\n▪ Overall, language needs to be clear, accessible, easy to understand, and follow.  \\n▪ Representation by local, district and provincial government was lacking at the \\nworkshop. \\n▪ Community calls on municipality to answer for lack of delivery of basic services, \\nincluding electricity, roads, water, and sanitation. \\n▪ Sanitation is being farmed out to private companies that are using wetlands to \\nprocess wastewater. This has profoundly negative effects on the wetlands, as \\nwell as on the downstream communities that make use of this water in the \\nabsence of piped municipal water.  \\n▪ Perception that government, particularly DMRE and Minister Mantashe, are not \\nwilling to engage, listen or act on behalf of the community. \\n▪ Coal mines and power plants are having negative impacts on the health of \\ncommunities, as well as the environment, but communities are dependent on \\nthese organisations for jobs and livelihoods based on the associated value \\nchains.  \\n▪ Understanding of the PCC, it’s structures and functions are lacking — this needs \\nto be addressed before and during the workshop e.g., Who constitutes the PCC? \\nHow were the commissioners selected? What authority does the PCC have? \\n▪ The break-away group structure will not work in initial engagements where \\nworkshops need to be run as plenaries and the bulk of the workshop time is likely \\nto be taken by communities communicating their challenges and frustrations \\nwith government processes. This is not surprising, as the workshops are a rare \\nopportunity for community members, NGOs and CSOs to meet government \\nrepresentatives in an open forum. The limited representation by local, district and \\nprovincial government at the workshop was noted by the attendees, who \\nexpressed their disappointment, as this is further evidence (in their eyes) of the \\nlack of willingness to engage on the side of government. \\n \\nPotential solutions \\n \\n▪ Decentralise alternative energy solutions to the community level. \\n▪ Build relevant skills among the youth. \\n▪ Government should engage with communities to develop solutions that are \\nappropriate and wanted by the communities.  \\n \\nIn conclusion, stakeholders feel the need to be involved at the policy and the action \\nlevels and are, in the main, strongly interested in aligning their efforts with the vision \\nof government. \\n \\n  '),\n",

Lephalale \\n \\nOverview \\n \\nLephalale Local Municipality is situated in the Limpopo Province within the \\nWaterberg District. It lies immediately east of the Waterberg Coalfield, an area with \\nvery rich coal deposits. The town is located on a national road, the N11, which is on \\nSouth Africa’s route to Botswana. The town is also linked to important provincial \\nroutes, such as Thabazimbi and Mokopane.  \\n \\nThe Lephalale municipal area comprises two urban nodes, namely Lephalale and \\nMarapong. These in turn are surrounded by the rural area of Witpoortjie/Thabo \\nMbeki, which is where the commercial and communal farming takes place.  \\n \\nThe economy of Lephalale is dominated by coal mining and coal-based electricity \\nproduction. Tourism, agriculture, and game farming make up the balance of the \\neconomy. Lephahale is rich with coal, which is mined by Exxaro at the Grootgeluk \\ncoal mine. The Waterberg coalfield is home to 40% of the coal resources that remain \\nin South Africa. Lephalale also houses two large coal-fired power stations, namely \\nMatimba (4000 MW) and the much newer Medupi (4800 MW once construction is \\ncompleted).  \\n \\nLephahale economic growth has been heavily dependent on coal mining. Low \\ngrade coal is used locally for supplying coal fired power stations, whilst high grade \\nore is exported. It has large reserves of coal underground which have still not been \\nmined but for which there appears to be a limited market. Lephahale is still locked \\ninto coal dependency, and the municipality has not yet confronted the challenges \\nof the of the just transition, such as what will happen to coal-based jobs, skills, and \\nlivelihoods, and what are the opportunities for alternate job and livelihood pathways \\narising from the transition?    \\n \\nFor these, and perhaps other reasons, Lephahale is one of the eight sites \\nrepresentative of the just transition issues facing South Africa. The workshop is \\ndesigned to elicit community voices, drawn from across society, on the fears and \\nopportunities facing Lephahale and to consider the key pathways and tangible \\nactions believed necessary to ensure a positive and inclusive outcome from the \\ncoal transition.  \\n \\nLocal perspectives \\n \\n▪ Local communities do not feel they benefit from mining operations, are excluded \\nfrom dialogues involving mining, are not provided with skills required for new \\nmines, and are heavily affected by the negative impacts of coal mining and \\ncoal driven energy e.g., water shortages, acid mine drainage and water \\npollution, air pollution (including from the dust from mine dumps) and health \\nimpacts '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='19 \\n \\n▪ Trade-off decisions as the just transition proceeds in Lephalale are therefore \\nnecessary; there is a need to balance the need for survival and jobs with the just \\ntransition.  \\n▪ Consensus on a just transition way forward for has not been reached at \\nprovincial or local level, yet clear action and follow through on tangible solutions \\nis both needed and desired.  \\n▪ Communities do not feel involved nor heard in engagements with the coal \\nsector and political representatives, there is no public participation from the \\nmunicipality and ward counsellors, and they say that engagements seldom yield \\ntangible outcomes.  \\n▪ Inclusivity is a major challenge. \\n▪ DMRE is not doing its job in issuing proper permits to mining companies, \\nmonitoring mine closures, and ensuring adequate mine land rehabilitation. \\n▪ There are no education/training centres for the youth and there is a mismatch \\nbetween skills available and those required. Youth wish to be at the forefront of \\nthe just transition but feel marginalised. \\n▪ Agricultural land is destroyed by coal mining, while Medupi has destroyed land \\nand seen the destruction of important cultural sites, such as cemeteries. The \\nmines do not support local farmers anymore, and there is a lack of \\ncommunication with farmers from the side of Exxaro and Sasol who own most of \\nthe land. \\n▪ Land in general is an issue, with some benefitting and many not. There are \\nhistorical land issues that need to be redressed.  \\n▪ Agriculture and game farms can play an important role in absorbing mine \\nworkers, but it is unlikely they can absorb the majority if the coal mines close.  \\n▪ It is imperative that transport of coal shifts from road to rail. \\n▪ There is a lack of understanding in the community regarding climate change \\nimpacts, the importance of biodiversity, and what the just transition is about. \\nThere is also a lack of understanding of renewable energy dynamics, costs, and \\nadvantages.  \\n▪ Women need to play a key role in the just transition and therefore hearing their \\nvoice is very important. \\n▪ There is a perception that both the mines and government are not engaging \\nmeaningfully with communities, and that the negative impacts of mining (e.g., \\nwater and health) are not taken seriously by the private and public sector. \\n▪ Communities are very worried about the future and their survival. There are \\npractical concerns around jobs, and access to basic services such as water. \\n▪ There is section of the population employed by the mines who wish to protect \\ntheir income, while this also has the potential to divide communities and block \\nconsensus on the pathways toward a just transition. \\n▪ Young people are thinking about their future, and the just transition pathways \\nneed to clearly locate the future of youth in those pathways. Schools outreach \\ninitiatives and well-aligned skills development will be important for raising \\nawareness, sensitising communities, and ensuring a stronger foundation for the \\njust transition in the future. \\n▪ Youth articulated some just transition solutions: perma-gardens, rainwater \\nharvesting, biogas and solar as alternative energy sources, eco-tourism, life and '),\n",

If youth don’t see the benefit \\nfor themselves in the transition, they will not engage. \\n▪ Overall, language needs to be clear, accessible, and easy to understand and \\nfollow.  \\n▪ As in eMalahleni, representation by local, district and provincial government was \\nlacking. \\n▪ Community calls on municipality to answer for lack of delivery of basic services. \\n▪ The community also points to unethical practices in the energy sector, for \\nexample, Medupi Power Station was built on ancestral graves. \\n▪ Coal mines and ESKOM must not close, the community is dependent on these \\norganisations for jobs and the associated value chains. \\n▪ Huge amounts of money were spent on Medupi Power Station, why close it now? \\nDo we understand the knock-on impacts of coal mine closures on the SA \\neconomy, including sectors beyond energy? New-born babies locally affected \\nby coal mining pollution \\n▪ Local youth mentally affected by absence of opportunities, high levels of \\ndepression \\n▪ Senior citizens attacked by youth for pension pay-out \\n▪ Rural communities are the hardest hit by joblessness and loss of livelihoods \\nbecause of climate change and service delivery issues. No skills. No jobs. No \\nbenefits. \\n▪ Young, skilled women are forced into prostitution to access limited opportunities \\n▪ Mining needs to be done differently to mitigate the negative health and \\nenvironmental impacts. For example, retrofitting ESKOM’s coal mines for blue \\ngas, this proposed was submitted in 2017 but has not been implemented to date. \\n▪ There is a perception that the push for the just transition process is led by \\ndeveloped economies and is a threat to South Africa’s economy, binding us to \\ninternational funding and the whims of private landowners. What evidence is \\nthere that the just transition process can provide jobs and resilient economy? \\n▪ A question has been raised regarding the agenda behind the funders of \\nenvironmental NGOs. \\n▪ As before, an understanding of the PCC, it’s structures and functions are lacking. \\n▪ We need to consider the economy-wide impacts of the just transition in terms of \\ncoal mine closures in South Africa and communicate to stakeholders that this will \\nbe done/is being done. \\n▪ We need to show communities demonstration cases to reassure them of the \\nfeasibility of renewable energy and other technologies considered under the just \\ntransition. \\n▪ This community wants to retain the mines and power stations to ensure that the \\nvalue chains upon which their livelihoods are built remain in place; however, they \\nwant available technology to be used to improve these industries and reduce \\ntheir health and environmental impacts. This position is reenforced by NUMSA. \\n▪ The community is calling for skills development, particularly for youth. But there \\nmust be a single, overarching plan at the national level, that guides skills \\ndevelopment programmes at the local level. \\n▪ Some service delivery issues must be addressed urgently: DMRE needs to be \\nanswerable regarding licenses; Implementation of SLP in current coal mining \\noperations; Water access issues for women in agriculture; Water license for '),\n",

South Durban Basin \\n \\nOverview \\n \\nSouth Durban Basin is the industrial hub of Durban, KwaZulu Natal Province. In total, \\nthe area is home to over 120 industries. As such, the South Durban Basin (SDB) \\ncomprises a complex mix of large-scale industries and major transport networks. The \\nindustries located in SDB are mainly chemical and petrochemical industries, with the \\nlargest concentration of the country’s petrochemical industries. The BP and Shell \\noperated South African Petroleum Refinery (SAPREF) and Engen are the main \\npetrochemical industries in the area. Mondi, the paper manufacturing company is \\nanother chemical industry in the SDB.  \\n \\nDurban is the largest city of the KwaZulu Natal Province. The city has a population of \\napproximately 2,5 million, with African, Indian, and Coloured people (generically \\nclassified as black communities) comprising the majority, mostly living in rapidly \\ngrowing informal settlements and formal low-income townships (the In Durban South, \\nspatial planning during the Apartheid era resulted in black communities residing \\nnear SDB industries, facilitating easy access of industries to cheap labour.  \\n \\nThe high concentration of industry coupled with the proximity of residential areas \\nand the consequences of the Apartheid spatial planning legacy, disproportionately \\nburdens low-income communities with environmental stress and public health \\nproblems and costs. People are living in poverty and work in hazardous \\nenvironments. In addition to the industrial pollution challenges, the area also houses \\nhazardous toxic waste landfill sites. A major concern in the area is the effects of air '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='22 \\n \\npollution on human health that are caused by the emissions of unacceptable levels \\nof toxins, chemical waste, and a large content of sulphur dioxide, which are \\ncharacteristic of concentrated industrial processes and activities. The situation has \\nbeen recognised by local Government, with the Durban Metro Council stipulating \\nthat the SDB is environmentally degraded, and experiences high levels of air \\npollution and waste disposal problems, and that the problems are additionally \\ncompounded by the loss of important natural resources (Jaggernath, 2011). The \\nquality of life of the communities located in and around the SDB is understood to be \\nseverely compromised by frequent environmental problems that arise from industrial \\nactivities. \\n  \\nAir quality is the primary environmental concern. It is a complex issue owing to the \\nrange of high emitting industrial processes in the area (from boilers to much more \\ncomplex industrial processes). The meteorological conditions of the area can \\nexacerbate the level of emissions by retarding the dispersion of pollutants (and at \\ntimes, assisting this process). Globally, the levels of pollution in the SDB are viewed as \\nbeing the highest, while a report ranking all South African air pollution monitoring \\nstations found that four of the most polluted are present in the SDB. Other serious \\nenvironmental problems in the SDB are heavy transport invasions of residential roads, \\naccidents caused by trucks, noise pollution and the illegal dumping of hazardous \\nwastes in the area (Jaggernath, 2011). \\n \\nRecent developments in the national environmental justice space as well as in the \\noil refinery industry have been taking place against this backdrop. A landmark \\njudgment was awarded in favour of environmental justice on Friday, 18th March \\n2022 in a case purported to have far reaching consequences. In the judgement, the \\nHigh Court recognised the poor air quality in the Mpumalanga Highveld region as a \\nbreach of the constitutional rights of residents to an environment that is not harmful \\nto their health and well-being. This judgement is important for SDB residents and \\nindustries in that it recognises air pollution as a violation of Constitutional rights and \\nas such, this is seen by the environmental justice movement as a victory for all \\naffected communities fighting for their right to clean air. Furthermore, the judgement \\nrecognises that the measures taken by Government to address dangerous levels of \\npollution do not protect the rights of affected communities and are inadequate.  \\n \\nAt the same time, BP and Shell recently announced that they will be pausing SAPREF \\noperations by the end of March 2022, following consultations with government, \\nunions, and employees. The pause in operations follows a decision to freeze \\nspending and to sell the refinery — South Africa’s largest crude oil refinery providing \\n35% of the national refining capacity. The pause in operations is stated by the \\noperators as one that will not impact full-time employees, while safety is a primary \\nconsideration. Discussions have commenced with government to nationalise the \\nrefinery, with the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government engaging in talks with the \\nenergy department about buying Sapref. The provincial government leadership \\nperspective is that retaining refinery operations in the province is key for economic \\ngrowth and job creation rather than solely relying on importing refined oil. With this, \\nthe other major refinery operator in the SDB, Engen, is planning to convert its refinery \\nto a terminal for importing cleaner by 2023. Upgrading South Africa’s refineries to '),\n",

This places the SDB residents, the municipality and the \\nKwaZulu Natal province and its surrounds at the heart of the just transition questions \\nfacing South African society, such as what will happen to fuel and chemical \\nindustry-based jobs, skills, and livelihoods, and what are the opportunities for \\nalternate job and livelihood pathways arising from the transition?  \\n \\nFor these, and perhaps other reasons, SDB is one of the eight sights representative of \\nthe just transition issues facing South Africa. The forthcoming just transition workshop \\nis designed to elicit community voices, drawn from across society, on the fears and \\nopportunities facing SDB and to consider the key pathways and tangible actions \\nbelieved necessary to ensure a positive and inclusive outcome from the coal \\ntransition. To prepare for the workshop, a PCC and OneWorld team visited SDB in \\nFebruary 2022 to obtain key insights, discuss the workshop representation and venue, \\nand to understand the challenges and obstacles facing communities in the \\ntransition, and for the workshop itself. \\n \\nLocal perspectives \\n \\n▪ SDCEA has been active since 1995 (15 years of activism) when they first saw the \\nwarning signs that the refineries in their community were coming to the end of \\ntheir lives and have been recording the incidences of explosions, fires, etc. \\n▪ According to SDCEA (and other community and environmental organisations) \\nthere is a common belief that the community is being fragmented intentionally, \\nalong racial, and socio-economic lines. \\n▪ Communities see themselves as the victims of Apartheid and now as the victims \\nof their own votes. \\n▪ In terms of the closure of refineries, there is recognition that all plants have a sell-\\nby date, that maintenance is lacking with pipes leaking, and that major industries \\nare decommissioning without engaging with their employees or the communities \\naround them, leaving communities surrounded by the refineries, because of poor \\ntown planning. \\n \\nThe following are among the key perceptions expressed: \\n▪ External people are brought in for jobs (Engen’s top management is not from this \\ncommunity) and Engen is perceived to be excluding the community (those that \\nspeak out are blacklisted), with a court case between the community and \\nEngen being ongoing since 2018. \\n▪ Workers are often employed on a seasonal basis and can get kicked out of \\nplants at a moment's notice, with devastating effects on individuals and families. \\n▪ The refineries are not transparent and there is no way to force disclosure of \\npractices and reports. \\n▪ Two thirds of the nation’s fuel come through the SDB but there is no plan, no \\ndisclosure and likely there is corruption, while the refineries are unable to \"),\n",

At the same time, there is a law that bordering communities \\nshould receive CSI from refineries, but the community has spent decades trying \\nto get CSI from Engen. \\n▪ Communities want a say in the contractors that access the refineries and ensure \\nthat the refineries make use of the skilled labour already present in the \\ncommunity, noting that a skills roster exists for this community, meaning that they \\nhave the skills to drive the just transition. \\n▪ Unions are not seen to be representing the casual workers, while it is important to \\nnot only look at jobs, but also at households and value chains. \\n▪ Engen has worked against CSOs in the past and this is on record, and they have \\nonly been doing as much as they legally must, while they also leverage \\nfragmentations in the community; however, new leadership at Engen does seem \\namenable to discussion. \\n▪ SDB is at saturation point in terms of pollution, with profits coming before people \\nand protests being the effective only route open to communities. With this, there \\nis a strong perception that Government is not listening. \\n▪ Communities want their lives and futures protected, while there is also \\nrecognition that remediation of the environmental issues has the potential to \\ncreate a lot of jobs. \\n▪ In terms of safety, there are no emergency plans in place communities, while the \\nonly safe space/green space left, the racecourse, has been sold off for a logistics \\nplant without any consultation with the community. \\n▪ There needs to be a plan in place for the closure of the refineries, that includes \\nthe communities, noting that management of the plants during the COVID \\nlockdown was not effective, with multiple explosions, damages to homes and no \\nresponsive action by industry or government, and no accountability of either \\ngroup. \\n▪ Environmental issues are significant with biodiversity being decimated, extensive \\npollution of the beaches and ocean and waste not being reduced at source. \\nCommunity members using polluted beaches are being poisoned and despite \\ntreatment processes, chemical leakages and sewage spills still occur and these \\nworsen on the event of heavy rains and floods. \\n▪ There are concomitant health risks with the logistics parks, which also house \\nhazardous chemical storage facilities, bringing heavy truck traffic, more pollution, \\nmore wear and tear on roads, and dangers for children. SO2 is causing high rates \\nof asthma among children, as well as cancers, and this is considered to all be \\nentirely preventable. Communities believe they need a health fund that can \\nprovide medical supplies to address asthma, cancers, heart disease and \\nfatalities. Notably, Chrome 6, produced by industrial processes and known to \\ncause cancer target respiratory systems as well as kidneys, liver, skin, and eyes, \\nhas been found in the soil. \\n▪ The 300 schools in the area are frustrated with the municipality which bills them \\nfor energy at the same rates as business, placing the schools in debt, which is '),\n",

Some schools see the just transition and renewable \\nenergy as a potential game-changer, taking them off the grid. \\n▪ Some stakeholders believe that the future lies in small business and not large \\nindustry, noting however that the children want to follow parents into industry. \\nContainer depots are taking over the area, businesses are being lost and job \\ncreation is non-existent in container depots. There are ~60 small businesses in the \\narea although some are not formally registered. \\n▪ History of spatial manipulation and apartheid planning that housed people \\nalongside industry, cemented class and culture differences. \\n▪ Legacy of this spatial planning and zoning schemes beginning in the early 1900s. \\n▪ In 2004 the South Durban Basin Area Based Management (ABM) office released \\na South Durban Spatial Development Framework without public participation. \\n▪ SDCEA opposed the plan and suggested an alternate community vision for the \\narea supported by 14 000 signatories. \\n▪ No effort from the eThekwini Municipality to engage on spatial development of \\nthe area since that time.  \\n▪ EIA applications for new and mostly industrial developments in the area.   \\n▪ Major incidents in the South Durban basin from 2000 to December 2021, including \\nfires and explosions.  More than 65 major incidents in the South Durban area \\nsince 2000, averaging ~3 major incidents per year. The SDB area is highly \\nhazardous and lacking an emergency response plan. Although residents have \\nbeen asking for a proper emergency evacuation plan and communications \\nprocedure since 1997, they have still been left unattended. \\n▪ There are voices which will dominate the dialogue, these need to be sensitively \\nmanaged. \\n▪ Engagements must be undertaken in the dominant local language with support \\nfor other languages in the room. \\n▪ A clear understanding of the PCC function and just transition process is needed.  \\n \\nPotential solutions \\n \\nNoting that the meaning of the just transition may change in time, the following \\nsolutions were put forward:  \\n▪ Green economy opportunities should be targeted but inclusively. A large solar \\nplant is not necessary; it is preferable to spread solar power out to every roof in a \\ncommunity and to let the community profit by selling power back to the grid, or \\nthrough reduced tariffs etc. and noting that it is possible to repurpose existing \\nmanufacturing plants to manufacture solar panels locally. \\n▪ Carbon offsetting should be considered, while economic activity through \\nventure capitalists or exchange funds should be encouraged. \\n▪ Reparation mechanisms need to be integrated into policy. \\n▪ Government needs to play a stronger role and engage with the community and \\nlisten to them. The mayor and local government are seen to be entirely absent in \\nengaging with this community, while there are no responses to problems that are \\nreported to the municipality. \\n▪ Training of local communities by industry, particularly among the unemployed in \\nthe 9 hostels in the area, should take place to redress prevalent social issues (the \\nhostels, designed to house migrant and casual workers, have become ridden '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='26 \\n \\nwith crime and violence as unemployment rises and violence spills out of the \\nhostels and drives away business. \\n▪ Redevelop existing infrastructure and balance environmental goals — this \\nbalance is possible. \\n \\nIn conclusion, stakeholders consulted appear to accept that the just transition must \\nhappen but believe that communities cannot be left behind as they have been in \\nthe past. The prevailing perception (among those consulted) is that a transition is \\nhappening, but there is no justice. \\n \\n6.4. Xolobeni \\n \\nOverview \\n \\nThe area being referred to as Xolobeni is a wider community—the Umgundlovu \\ncommunity—which has been settled in the area since 1700-1800s. Xolobeni (which \\nshould be spelled Xholobeni) is one of five main villages in the area occupied by the \\ncommunity. The Umgundlovu community has been largely remained under \\ntraditional governance and resisted the authority of the colonial government. A key \\nvalue of the community is self-determination, the freedom to make their own \\ndecisions about their natural resources and to protect their interests.  \\n \\nThe community aligned themselves strongly aligned with the ANC in the 1980s and \\nthrough the 1990s there was perception that good progress had been made jobs, \\nservices, tourism and leveraging private sector partners.  \\n \\nFor example, in the 1980s and 1990s Richards Bay Minerals owned the mining rights \\nto the area. However, a shift occurred in the early 2000s when the Australian group \\nMineral Commodities Ltd started looking into mining ilmenite along 22km of the \\ncoast. The push for coastal mining by Mineral Commodities Ltd has resulted in a hotly \\ncontested divide within the community, as has the proposed toll road. The toll road \\nwas planned in the 1950s–1960s to integrate the Transkei region with the rest of the \\nnational highway network, the route planned in the late 1990s was to start at the \\nWildCoast Sun and cross the Umgundlovu community land.  There is a perception \\nthat the construction of this road is supporting by the mining sector, as it would \\nintersect with where the mining by Mineral Commodities Ltd would take place, \\nallowing the company to use the road to ship their minerals. SANRAL has denied \\ntheir intention support mining through the proposed route. There are also reportedly \\nplans in place for the construction of a ‘smart city’ in the area, as well as \\nconsiderations for offshore oil and gas exploration.  \\n \\nDivision within the community, particularly in those that are resisting mining and the \\nconstruction of the toll road has at times resulted in violence, with frequent reports of \\nintimidation and one related murder to date. Members of the Umgundlovu \\ncommunity, aided by Richard Spoor Attorneys, have gone to court several times in \\nthe last decade to prevent mining being undertaken in the area without the \\nconsent of the community has a whole.

       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='27 \\n \\n \\nThere is consensus that consultations with the community have been lacking and/or \\nwholly ineffective to date. A general sense of disappointment and distrust in the \\ngovernment and any related process or project is clear. \\n \\nLocal perspectives \\n \\n▪ Engage with both District and Local Municipal structures as well as the traditional \\nauthority structures when planning engagements. \\n▪ It is strongly recommended to plan the community engagements as community \\ndialogues or an imbizo, rather than a workshop — given that there is a need for \\nsubstantial preparatory work before this community will be willing to engage in \\nany sort of planning. \\n▪ Plan engagements to take place on a neutral ground where all community \\nfactions can have equal footing and opportunity to speak. There are nuances \\nhere regarding the perceived ‘territory’ of various factions, holding a meeting in \\na particular area could prevent full participation.  \\n▪ Understanding will need to be built regarding the PCC, its function, authority, and \\nintentions with the community. \\n▪ The community will need to see tangible steps being made should the just \\ntransition consultative process continue in the area. \\n▪ The absence of a large proportion of the commissioners, and the absence of the \\nministers, did not sit well with the community, adding to prevailing sense of \\ndistrust. \\n▪ The local municipality has been ineffective in engaging with this community. \\nThey need to be involved in these discussions and held accountable and they \\nshould have been in the ‘room’.  \\n▪ Government interventions have not always been appropriate for the community \\ncontext. An example is given of an agricultural project that relied on extensive \\nuse of pesticides. The community does not want to ‘poison’ their land and water.  \\n▪ There is concern about misalignment within the government, conflicting actions, \\nand programmes. \\n▪ The planned toll road should run north of the community; it would be more useful \\nthere. Why does it have to cut across their land between them and the sea? \\n▪ The government has done little for community, in their eyes. They do not trust that \\nthe PCC process will yield anything. \\n▪ The community has not benefitted from projects and programmes that promised \\nthem jobs. \\n▪ There is the potential for developing eco-tourism within this community. \\n▪ There is a need for improved water services.  \\n▪ There is a need for access to education for the community, particularly tertiary \\neducation. \\n▪ The community lacks access to healthcare services.  \\n▪ Corruption results in promised money for road improvements etc. not \\nmaterialising. \\n▪ Overall feeling is that the community has been looking after itself up until this \\npoint. There have been promises, but no action.  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='28 \\n \\n▪ Key is that the community prefers not to be dependent on government and \\nperceives that this is what government is attempting to achieve. The community \\nprefers to be empowered.  \\n▪ Understanding of the PCC, it’s structures and functions are lacking — this needs \\nto be addressed before and during the workshop. Who constitutes the PCC? \\nHow were the commissioners selected? What authority does the PCC have? \\n▪ The project team did obtain a sufficient understanding of the dynamics within \\nthis community ahead of the Imbizo. A key insight from the Xolobeni \\nengagement is that it is likely better to delay community workshops in areas \\nwhere a full and comprehensive understanding of the dynamics within the \\ncommunity had not yet been established.  \\n▪ Key voices were missing, for example from the youth, thus limiting a \\ncomprehensive view of the issues and proposed solutions. \\n▪ Additional time is therefore needed to engage with the district and local \\nmunicipalities, as well as with traditional leadership structures.  \\n▪ Trust needs to be built with the community, they are looking for an early return \\ndate and tangible outcomes from this engagement. \\n \\nPotential solutions \\n \\n▪ Allow community to take part in small-scale fisheries operations, to date licences \\nhave not been granted to community members. \\n▪ Develop tourism, making use of undisturbed coastline and archaeological sites. \\n▪ Establish schools and colleges in the area so that young people do not have to \\ntravel far to receive a quality education. \\n▪ Construct clinics in the area to ensure that the community can access \\nhealthcare. \\n▪ Ensure that financing granted to improve roads etc. reaches the community and \\nis not side-lined by the municipality. \\n▪ Engage the community to develop appropriate water supply solutions. \\n▪ Engage with the community to develop improved agricultural programmes that \\nare based on local knowledge and do not rely on chemical pesticides and \\nfertilisers. \\n▪ Improve education curriculums to include climate change. \\n \\n6.5. Gqeberha \\n \\nOverview \\n \\nThe Eastern Cape site, Gqeberha, is home to a significant component of South \\nAfrica’s automotive industry. Around 10,000 jobs depend on the motor industry in \\nGqeberha, with VWSA and Isuzu being the lead firms in motor vehicle \\nmanufacturing in the municipality. With this, there are many component \\nmanufacturers and other small business that support the lead firms.  \\n \\nThe industry in Gqeberha has already experienced job losses because of the \\ndisinvestment of General Motors in South Africa in 2017. This resulted in the sale of '),\n",

With this, local government’s \\nability to deliver basic services has deteriorated, a situation that has been \\nexacerbated by the coalition government that came into being following local \\ngovernment elections in 2021.  \\n \\nLocal perspectives \\n \\n▪ The domestic market for EVs is shrinking (there has been a decline in local \\ndemand since 2014, concomitant with low economic growth and a shrinking \\nmiddle class that is where the demand for cars lies) and the export market is a \\nmainstay of the South African manufacturing industry. With this, European exports \\ndominate. \\n▪ The South African motor industry is unlikely to survive the transition to zero emission \\nvehicles if it does not produce and export EVs. \\n▪ Experts and analysts believe that South Africa will not be able to competitively \\nproduce battery packs, limiting the locally manufactured components of EVs. \\n▪ The small business community and some economic development officials in the \\nNelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality have a contradictory view and \\nbelieve that South Africa can compete effectively and has the expertise and \\nskills to do so. \\n▪ The motor industry (VWSA) and the Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber \\nconfirm the risk of not manufacturing EVs for the export market and are \\nconcerned as to the uptake of EVs in the local market in the absence of \\ngovernment incentives that would increase the affordability and therefore the \\naccessibility of EVs in the domestic portion of their market. \\n▪ The NYDA is highly active in Gqeberha and is working toward promoting and \\nsupporting entrepreneurial activities among the youth.  \\n▪ Civil society is active but fragmented, with organisations proliferating across \\nvarious interest groups, including environmental justice and economic \\ndevelopment. Care must be taken in engaging civil society and civic \\norganisations to ensure comprehensive representation.   \\n▪ The lack of and continued deterioration of basic service delivery and poor \\ngovernance and maintenance is negatively affecting economic development \\nand compromising jobs and livelihoods in the area. The coalition government is a \\nmajor concern, with problems including constantly changing leadership and \\nofficials, slow recruitment processes in local government and inability to agree on \\nselection of key officials and on city budgets.  \\n▪ Community members and small businesses want to be actively engaged in local \\ngovernment tenders and protests and violence is rife when they do not get \\nawarded local tenders. \\n▪ Basic service delivery is an issue in the city.  \\n▪ There is a general lack of trust in the municipality. \\n▪ Lack of response from both government and PCC when sending emails is \\neroding confidence of community actors.

Hotazel \\n \\nOverview \\n \\nThe community engagements in the Northern Cape were undertaken in the broader \\nmining complex encompassed by Kuruman, Hotazel and Kathu. Mining in the \\nNorthern Cape is estimated to employ ~15,000 people and contribute ~18 percent \\nto the provincial economy (Minerals Council South Africa, no date). Manganese, \\niron ore and diamonds are the dominant mining products. Mining companies have \\nreportedly invested over R700 million in development projects in the province over \\nthe last five years (Minerals Council South Africa, no date). Nonetheless, poverty \\nremains rampant as there are limited job opportunities — even within the mining \\nsector. Access to water and electricity, as well as health and education services is a \\ncontinual struggle, particularly for communities on the edge of mining towns or \\ndispersed within the broader arid landscape. There is little public transport available, \\nand roads are in poor condition. \\n \\nIn recent years, several renewable energy companies—mostly solar power—have \\nstarted developments in the Northern Cape. Communities remain divided over the \\nfuture benefits of these operations as they feel they have yet to have any \\nmeaningful engagements with the largely foreign companies or see any benefit \\nfrom the projects they are running. In terms of the just transition, there is a need to \\ninvest additional time and resources into building a baseline understanding of the \\nprocess, its governance and framework before meaningful consultation can be \\nundertaken with a broader range of stakeholders. \\n \\nLocal perspectives \\n \\n▪ Of all the stakeholders consulted only one (Gopolang Nels from Ga-Segonyana \\nLocal Municipality) exhibited a meaningful understanding of a just transition, the \\nimperatives behind it, and what it means in practice. There is a clear gap in '),\n",

It needs to be simplified and \\ncommunicated to communities in a relatable format, preferably through \\ncommunity organisations and leadership structures which are trusted. \\n▪ Further consultation and the site visit highlighted that the catchment area for the \\nworkshop should include the broader mineral complex that encompasses \\nHotazel, Kathu and Kuruman (JTG District Municipal area) \\n▪ There is a very low density of stakeholders within this complex. Many of these are \\nconcentrated around mines in Hotazel, Kathu and Kuruman, but there is a larger \\narea of rural and arid lands which houses a community dependent on \\nsubsistence agriculture. This broader, low-density community is vulnerable to \\nclimate change impacts, as well as downscaling or shifts in the mining sector.  \\n▪ Representation of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union \\n(AMCU) is very low in the Hotazel-Kathu-Kuruman complex. \\n▪ AMCU lost their recognition at Kumba’s Sishen Mine and is not very active in the \\narea. \\n▪ Both the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and Solidarity remain active in the \\ncomplex.  \\n▪ The just transition implies a loss of jobs in mining and power sectors, how will this \\nbe managed? These sectors create many jobs and there is no immediately \\nobvious alternative. \\n \\nRenewable Energy: \\n▪ There are solar/renewable energy operators in the complex and this is a sector \\nwhere more job opportunities are emerging. \\n▪ These companies have license obligations to support socio-economic \\ndevelopment, but there has been limited activity in this area according to \\nanecdotal reports. \\n▪ We need to establish a baseline understanding of the technologies we have in \\nSouth Africa that can support a just transition at this time.  \\n▪ Communities lack expertise in terms of renewable energy technologies, and this \\nis an area that will require investment in skills building etc.  \\n▪ There is little to no alignment between recently launched Northern Cape Green \\nHydrogen Strategy and national policies. \\n▪ Can we invest in technology to reduce the impact of coal, as well as — or in \\nsome cases instead of — phasing out coal? \\n▪ How will the just transition compensate for the loss of jobs in the mining/energy \\nsectors?

Carolina \\n \\nOverview \\n \\nCarolina is the centre of the Chief Albert Luthuli Municipality (CALM) within the Gert \\nSibande District Municipality (GSDM). The economy of the district is driven by mining, \\npetrochemical industries, energy generation and supply, agriculture, forestry, and \\nsome manufacturing. Notably, four of the country’s 10 operational coal-fired power \\nstations are located within the GSDM, and their potential closure threatens \\nembedded supply chains, sectoral linkages, and job and economic security in the \\narea. The economy of Carolina, and the CALM, is linked to the community services \\nsector such as government departments, job creation/welfare programmes, as well \\nas the retail sector. It is the mining sector that underpins the economic and social \\nstructures of Carolina, yet it contributes relatively little to the local economy and \\nprovides limited employment. There is a clear understanding among community \\nmembers that there is a trade-off between the negative impacts of coal mining on \\ninfrastructure, health, and the environment on one hand, and the need for job \\ncreation and income from coal mining on the other. The negative impacts of mining \\nare extensive, coal trucks moving through the town contribute to crime and \\nprostitution and constrain tourism.   \\n \\nSmall scale mining tends to take over and break up farmlands. Mine rehabilitation \\nhas not been conducted, and mine dumps continue to leach toxins into arable soils \\nrendering it sub optimal or useless. Acid mine drainage leaks from empty pits and \\nseeps into the water table disrupting agricultural activity and contaminating drinking \\nwater. Although a Mining Forum was established to facilitate discussions with the \\nlocal community about mining operations, the members of the Forum do not \\ncollaborate on drafting social and labour plans (SLPs) or related projects. Their focus \\nhas been on avoiding duplication of effort, rather than a holistic plan which \\nconsiders the just transition and the wellbeing of communities. \\n '),\n",

However, there are \\nseveral barriers to achieving this growth. From an organizational perspective, the \\ntourism sector does not have a functional centre for coordination, and activities are \\ndispersed and fragmented. The existing tourism association has a limited \\nmembership base and does not collaborate with commercial tourist operators. A \\nsimilar problem exists in the agricultural sector, with a lack of a robust and effective \\norganization guiding agricultural development in the CALM.  \\n \\nGiven the competency of the local municipality, there is a good basis of \\nunderstanding among Carolina stakeholders of the just transition and the need for a \\ncomprehensive strategy to guide future development. Most of the municipal \\nresources have been focused on poverty alleviation and there is an urgent need to \\naddress infrastructure and service delivery issues, particularly considering the \\nambition to increase tourism through the area. The institutional conditions for a just \\ntransition already exist in Carolina, but that an enabling environment will need to be \\nestablished to realise this. There is considerable work needed to build working \\nrelationships and trust between sectoral actors before a consensus can be reached \\non the way forward. \\n \\nLocal perspectives \\n \\n▪ Air and water pollution by mining/energy companies is having negative health \\nimpacts for communities. \\n▪ Houses are often damaged by blasting and there is no compensation from the \\nmines. \\n▪ Mines remain insensitive to the need for rehabilitation and the negative impacts \\nthat failing to undertake this process has on the environment and communities. \\n▪ Too many coal trucks on the road are causing damage to road infrastructure. \\n▪ Transportation is a huge challenge in Carolina, and this makes the cost of \\nbusiness go up. \\n▪ Carolina is a ghost town but has considerable potential for development, \\nparticularly given is position on routes to Mozambique, eSwatini and Kwa-Zulu \\nNatal. \\n▪ There is a pervading concern that fourth industrial revolution might replace \\npeople, increasing job losses. Unemployment is already high and social problems \\nlike drugs and crime are on the rise. \\n▪ Access to mines by locals is not supported by government and there is a fair \\namong of illegal mining taking place. \\n▪ Gender issues in the mining and energy sectors must be dealt with. Women are \\nnot being hired by mines and there are extensive problems with gender-based \\nviolence which is directly linked to mining. \\n▪ The existing SLP undertaken by mines is not aligned to community needs. There \\nwere also allegations of SLP money being misused by the municipality, with funds \\nnot serving community needs. \\n▪ Youth are not able to access opportunities for skills development. There are no \\nTVETs for students beyond matric, so locals are forced to travel to access \\neducation and training. '),\n",

Both are seen to be unaffordable for a large portion of the \\ncommunity. There are also ongoing issues with quality and delivery of these.  \\n \\nPotential solutions \\n \\n▪ Limit issuance of mining permits for coal until the corruption within mining \\ncompanies and DMRE is addressed.  \\n▪ Alternatively, issue licences to local communities to create jobs, rather than large \\nmining companies. \\n▪ Prioritise economic growth of Carolina to prevent the increase of crime and \\nother social ills through job creation. \\n▪ Grant the community access to land so that they can revitalise agriculture in the \\narea to increase food security. \\n▪ Revitalise public transport systems for Carolina. \\n▪ Invest in skills development for youth to enable them to participate in the just \\ntransition. \\n▪ If mines are unwilling to undertake rehabilitation, pay communities to undertake \\nrehabilitation on unused mining land, which can then be used for agriculture etc. \\n▪ Improve alignment and coordination across all levels of government. \\n▪ Hold mining companies accountable for lack of compliance with regards to \\nrehabilitation and environmental restrictions. \\n▪ Empower communities to take on the challenge of sustainable mining and \\nagricultural practices. \\n▪ Invest in skills development for women and youth to increase their participation in \\nthe economy and reduce social ills associated with poverty and unemployment. \\n \\n6.8. Secunda \\n \\nOverview \\n \\nSecunda lies within the Gert Sibande District Municipality and is governed by the \\nGovan Mbeki Local Municipality (GMLM). The economy of the district is driven by \\nmining, manufacturing, trade, and construction (Municipalities of South Africa, no \\ndate). GMLM encompasses mainly agricultural land, with Secunda being one of the \\nmain urban centres and the seat of the municipality (Govan Mbeki Municipality, \\n2021). The economy of the GMLM is dominated by the petrochemical industry \\n(namely, the SASOL II and III complexes), as well as coal and gold mining. The \\npopulation continues to grow as more people seek opportunities within these \\nsectors, constraining the ability of the GMLM to provide basic services. Notably, \\n~56% the population can be classified as poor, with average monthly household \\nincomes reaching a maximum of R3,200 (Govan Mbeki Municipality, 2021). \\n \\nThe skyline and local economy of Secunda is dominated by the activities of energy \\ngiant Sasol (Sguazzin, 2020), which operates five mines in the area, as well as \\nSecunda power station (Sasol, no date). This station has been identified by national \\nand international actors as the world’s largest single-site emitter (Sguazzin, 2020). As '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='37 \\n \\nwith several of the other sites examined under this project, these operations are \\ncritical to the local economy and employ a significant number of the local \\npopulation. Sasol has also made considerable investments into Secunda and is in \\nthe process of setting targets for emissions reductions. Nonetheless, the pollution \\nfrom the energy and mining activities in the area are having negative impacts on \\nthe health and wellbeing of surrounding communities, as well as the natural \\nenvironment. A balanced approach is needed to address the concerns of the \\ncommunity and plan for sustainable future development, while safeguarding health \\nand wellbeing. \\n \\nLocal perspectives \\n \\n▪ The Secunda/Vaal area was declared a high priority area in terms of air quality in \\n2008. Nothing has happened since then. The community wants to see resources \\nto actively resolve the problem. Sasol compliance must be enforced by \\nGovernment. Community based organisations who are working on these issues \\nmust be resourced with office space and affected people must be targeted and \\ncommunity work must be incentivised. \\n▪ There is a perception that Sasol, as one of the major industries in the area, does \\nnot support communities and is not giving their concerns (particularly those \\nrelated to health, labour deployment and skills development) due consideration. \\nSasol is not giving back to the community, while the Govan Mbeki Municipality is \\na “corner to corner dumping site and scrapyard municipality”. Perceptions are \\nthat the Municipality won’t benefit and that is why they are not here, once again \\ndemonstrating low levels of cooperation and commitment. \\n▪ The just transition is a double-edged sword: “It is inevitable that that we will lose \\njobs.” \\n▪ Issues were raised as to how Sasol will absorb youth into their programs—are \\nthere plans to create jobs or provide training for youth? \\n▪ Trust has been damaged as stakeholders report that Sasol provides training with \\npromise of employment, then shifts the goal posts for employment, requiring \\nadditional experience or training.  \\n▪ The justice system is failing communities and favours the rich.  \\n▪ There is a lack of service delivery in informal settlements, the roads, for example, \\nare in very poor condition. \\n▪ DMRE not sensitive to gender parity when giving opportunities for mining.  \\n▪ The just transition process will need to address inequality to ensure that people \\nare not left behind and that the process is truly just. \\n▪ Retrofit houses with solar solutions and decentralise production of renewable \\nenergy products and systems to create jobs within communities. \\n▪ Revitalise the public transport system at a local level (trains and busses). \\n▪ Empower relevant officials to police implementation of SLPs. \\n▪ Existing groups such as South African Women in Mining Association (SAWIMA) \\nhave plans and programs to address the needs of communities but lack funding \\nsupport. There is also the challenge of relevant officials not coming to the party \\n(e.g., Mintek/NQA). \\n▪ Community members expressed the need for a balance between environmental \\npreservation and development. There is a need development for jobs, but at '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='38 \\n \\nsame time there is a need for sustainability. How do we get this balance, \\nparticularly in energy given that Eskom is also culprit in terms of pollution? Who \\nwill hold the SOEs to account? Government is also part of the pollution issue, and \\nthe Green Scorpions initiative seems to have disappeared. With this, there are \\nunderground water and mining issues. Landfills are not being managed to \\nstandard and national government is not doing anything about this. Important to \\nthe balance is taking care of local communities. They are not benefitting from \\ncompanies causing the pollution. Local people are unemployed and sick and \\nare not benefitting from job and business opportunities. Penalties don’t work as \\nthese just allow business to continue with business as usual. Rather, business \\nlicences must be taken away if they don’t comply.  \\n▪ Sasol 2 and 3 is biggest industry in the world. Profitable and big but not investing \\nin cleaning air pollution (and clean technology).  \\n▪ Climate change is an issue already and affects local people. Communities will \\nsupport CC but want action and accountability \\n▪ Sasol should take responsibility but oppresses black people, systematically. SLPs \\ndon’t help and are not done consultatively. The Mining Charter is not being \\nimplemented effectively. Govan Mbeki municipality is surrounded by mines and \\ntherefore this is a mining community, but head office employs and leads / \\nmanages from Joburg without engaging the CBOs and NPOs.  \\n▪ “Localisation is null and void” \\n▪ People need a clearer understanding of the just transition. \\n▪ “We are in trauma as a people, we participate in this journey whilst in trauma — \\nwe are NOT fighting anyone, we just ask for honesty from business and \\ngovernment.” \\n▪ The real impact of the just transition process must be quantified and transparently \\ncommunicated before communities are asked to commit to the process e.g., \\nWho sets the agenda? What is the expected cost of the just transition? Can we \\nquantify the risk of job losses? What are the expected impacts on youth? What \\nare the expected impacts on existing value chains? \\n▪ Communities in South Africa do have a wide skills base. Can the manufacturing \\nsector in this country be revitalised? \\n▪ There was a suggestion that just transition ambassadors be identified from among \\nworkshop attendees. \\n▪ Avoid the use of bottled water in workshops, avoid plastic pollution and “walk \\nthe talk”. \\n▪ Clear recognition that climate change is an issue and must be addressed — but \\nthere are perceptions that this can be addressed through different avenues to \\ngetting rid of coal, as there are also opportunities for clean coal. \\n▪ The lack of understanding plus misinformation on renewable energy abounds \\nsuggesting anti RE campaign. \\n▪ Governance trumps. Without this the transition will not be just.  \\n▪ Decisions about the transition must involve the community through the \\nprocedural justice element and through reflecting all the view raised and \\ndelivering to highest level of Government. \\n \\nA key takeaway message is that this transition must go hand in hand with economic \\ntransformation in South Africa. We can’t ignore that we are coming off a low base '),\n",

There can be no \\n(just) transition unless we create jobs, enable broad economic ownership, and \\naddress redistribution of land.  \\n \\nPotential solutions \\n \\n▪ Institute a capacitated committee in Mpumalanga that is skilled and \\nempowered to consider what must be done (and execute/oversee \\nimplementation). Sasol (and Eskom) must be involved in the committee. \\n▪ Remove corrupt judges, law enforcement and other officials. If a task team is \\ninstituted, those people must be dedicated. \\n▪ Retrofit houses with solar solutions and decentralise production of renewable \\nenergy products and systems to create jobs within communities. \\n▪ Water solutions and better disaster preparedness. Climate change is happening \\nnow and the negative effects of it are felt every day. Need more resilient \\ninfrastructure and more sustainable human settlements. Recognition that it is not \\npossible to move all shacks immediately, but the process must be better planned \\nand managed \\n▪ Revitalise the public transport system at a local level (trains and busses). \\n▪ Empower relevant officials to police implementation of SLPs. \\n▪ Existing groups such as South African Women in Mining Association (SAWIMA) \\nhave plans and programs to address the needs of communities but lack funding \\nsupport. There is also the challenge of relevant officials not coming to the party \\n(e.g., Mintek/NQA). \\n▪ Land is needed for various youth programs and agriculture programs. \\n▪ Ownership and entrepreneurship – doors opening for young people in energy \\nproduction, but they don’t have enough resources and skills and information. \\nResearch to rather use our coal (better) rather than move to renewable energy is \\nan option. \\n▪ Need local innovation and building on intellectual property of young people’s \\nideas. Restorative justice is important in terms of social health (crimes and drugs).  \\n \\n7. Learnings from the Process of Engaging Communities \\n \\nIn addition to the above-mentioned messages from the community engagements, \\nthere are also important process lessons to take on board in both planning for and \\nconvening future community engagements. \\n \\nUnderstanding of the PCC, it’s structures and functions, is lacking; this needs to be \\naddressed early in the just transition process. The following questions need to be \\naddressed in consultations: Who constitutes the PCC? How were the commissioners \\nselected? What authority does the PCC have?  How will the PCC drive the just \\ntransition process in South Africa? \\n \\nVisibility of Commissioners. Commissioners need to be more visible in the just \\ntransition process and in community engagements. On average, four to five \\ncommissioners participated in each engagement under this project, whereas the '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './downloaded_pdfs/usefuldocs\\\\Community-Consultations-on-a-Just-Transition-May-2022.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='40 \\n \\ncommissioners total 23 (with an additional 10 government ministers). Commissioners \\nrepresent different constituencies, therefore if only a handful are in the room, only a \\nhandful of constituencies are seen to be represented.  \\n \\nPlenary sessions, at least in the first round of workshops/Imbizos, are preferable. The \\nbreak-away group structure was found to be impractical for the first round of \\nworkshops, which had to be run as plenaries, not least because this was a rare \\nopportunity for different social partner groups to be in the same room. With this, the \\nexperience has been that the bulk of the workshop time will be taken by \\ncommunities communicating their challenges and frustrations with government \\nprocesses and low economic development. The use of break-away groups or other \\nmeeting structures should be re-evaluated for follow-up consultations. \\n \\nThere are voices which will dominate the dialogue, these need to be sensitively \\nmanaged, with careful facilitation. Some social partner groups are likely to be \\nmobilised more than others, creating imbalanced representation in the room during \\nconsultations. During this project, this was likely a function of both the site visits where \\nsome social partners were engaged and not others, allowing those that were \\nengaged plenty time to prepare, and of the activities of commissioners highly active \\nin specific locations, resulting in mobilisation of some constituencies and not others. \\nAs a result, we have at times missed key voices and have not succeeded in \\nleveraging a comprehensive view of the issues and proposed solutions. \\n \\nEngagements must be facilitated in the dominant local language with support for \\nother languages in the room.  \\n \\nLocal and district municipalities and traditional leadership, where appropriate, must \\nbe in the room. Additional time than this process has allowed is required to engage \\nwith the district and local municipalities, as well as with traditional leadership \\nstructures to ensure that they are available and prepared to participate.  \\n \\nAccessible venues. It is essential to use accessible venues such as the workshop held \\nin the central city hall in Emalahleni, and the Imbizo held at Komkhulu in Xolobeni, \\nboth of which allowed for more people to attend (in terms of logistics and travel) \\nthan would otherwise have been the case. This is particularly important as most \\nattendees will be relying on public transportation. Furthermore, community-oriented \\nvenues, such as the Austerville Community Hall in South Durban Basin, help to create \\na space for community voices as they are not intimidating in any way.  \\n \\n8. Conclusion \\n \\nThere is little doubt that communities represented through this project understand \\nthe negative development impacts of climate change and the just transition. This is \\neven though they lack a clear understanding of the dynamics and details of the just \\ntransition to a low carbon and climate resilient society. Communities are \\nexperiencing the pain of climate change impacts, combined with poor basic \\nservice delivery and governance, and their anger and frustration over low/no '),\n",

Apart from the obvious \\ninterventions around job creation, security and skills development that are directly \\nrelated to the just transition, the overall take away from this process is that the \\ntransition cannot be ‘just’ if people do not experience equitable and adequate \\nbasic service delivery (water and sanitation, electricity, and waste management) \\nand do not have inclusive access to usable land.  \\n \\nThere are three key issues that will clearly impede buy-in to South Africa’s just \\ntransition and will therefore potentially impact its effective implementation. These \\nare corruption (often combined with perceptions of lack of caring by government), \\ncoupled with poor governance (largely expressed in terms of poor municipal \\nmanagement, dysfunctional coalition local governments, and a DMRE that is widely \\nperceived as not delivering its mandate), and industry neglect (articulated as not \\nadequately investing its gains back into enabling the development of local \\ncommunities).  \\n \\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa’s recent emphasis on implementing government’s \\nplanned District Development Model (announced at the South African Local \\nGovernment Association conference in March 2022) which aims to improve the \\ncountry’s municipalities is timely for the just transition process and should be explicitly \\nintegrated in the Just Transition Framework. The District Development Model aims to \\nimprove coordination between national, provincial, and local governments, and \\nbetween government and its social partners. Given many of the barriers raised to an \\neffective just transition by communities, this coordination (if given the necessary \\nteeth) will be a critical success factor to its implementation. In particular, the model \\nseeks to bring coherence to planning and implementation, and in turn is expected \\nto bring clarity of understanding across the three spheres of government as to what \\nis needed, where it is needed, how and by whom it will be done, and exactly what \\nthe costs will be.  This approach is aligned with a just transition that is tailored to \\ncommunity needs, including an effective enabling environment, skills and skills \\ndevelopment requirements, job and enterprise development opportunities, and \\nincentives appropriate to inclusive community participation.  \\n \\n  '),\n",

This \\ndocument sets out our approach to delivering 30by30 on land in England. Biodiversity policy \\nis devolved in the UK, and therefore Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will set out their \\napproaches to delivering this target separately. \\nContributions to the target \\nNew contributions to the 30by30 target will be made on a voluntary basis, and there \\nis no obligation on landowners or land managers to participate. Contributing to the \\n30by30 target simply recognises where an area is already being effectively protected \\nand managed for biodiversity conservation. Whilst any  existing designation \\nrequirements (including nature or heritage designations) will continue to apply, new \\n30by30 contributions do not represent any new management requirements or \\ndesignation. Landowners or land managers will be able to withdraw their contribution \\nat any point if they wish. \\n30by30 should be a collaborative, voluntary effort, led by those who are driving nature’s \\nrecovery on the ground. Achieving this ambitious commitment presents an important \\nopportunity to continue the UK’s international leadership on nature protection. This will \\nrequire a collaborative, cross-sector approach, and everyone has an important role to play. \\nThat is why we will be opting for a bottom -up approach.

The development \\nperiod had to be extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  \\nThis NECP builds on the National Energy Strategy and the first NDC and has been aligned with the \\ndraft of the revised NDC. Differences compared to the existing policy documents have been analysed \\nand can be attributed to, among others, the need for adjustments due to the evolving knowledge base. \\nDetailed explanation is provided in chapter 2.  \\nDrafting the N ECP calls for a broad range of reliable and consistent data. The most relevant data on \\nclimate change have been collected and processed by the UNDP technical assistance projects during the \\npreparation of the National Communications to UNFCCC.  With regard to the NECP drafting process, \\naccessibility of data and the level of detail was not always ideal  due to different procedures and \\ntimelines. Despite of these challenges, good progress has been made with alignment of NECP and NDC \\nfor future progress reports a nd updates. Nevertheless, formal actions are necessary to ensure \\ndisaggregated data collection, data consistency and data transparency for future activities.  \\n \\n1.1.1 Political, economic, environmental, and social context of the plan \\nPolitical context:  \\nIt can be summarized that there is policy and legislation in place for each of the five dimensions of the \\nEnergy Union.  \\nAlbania is involved in the process of creating a supportive domestic energy market, ensuring energy \\nsecurity, energy efficiency, environmental p rotection including GHG emissions reduction which are \\ndescribed and presented through so many planned measures and investments identified in different \\npolicy documents. The National Strategy of Energy, 2 nd and 3 rd Action plan on EE, Consolidated \\nRenewable Energy Action Plan, National Plan for the Mitigation of GHG and the Strategy of Transport \\nhave defined objectives and targets on increasing the security of supply by investments in the power \\nsector, gas penetration in the Albanian market, increasing the sh are of RES and EE followed by a \\nreduction of GHG emissions.  \\nThe law no.155/2020 on Climate Change has created the basis for transposition of the  Governance \\nRegulation and the relevant EU legislation on climate change.  \\nFor the full implementation and enforcement of energy and climate policies, the secondary legislation \\non energy efficiency including the energy performance in buildings is fully adopted during 2020 and the \\nsecondary legislation on renewable energy sources is still in the process of being  drafted or drafting \\nneeds to be started.  \\nThe institutional setup for planning and reporting energy and climate related policies and measures is \\nunder development. The following institutions and professions that have been establish by law need still '),\n",

Many investments foreseen \\nto be realised in whole energy sector will have a very gr eat impact to increase the sectorial GDPs, \\ngenerating revenues and the increase in labour forces in different areas.  \\nPolicies and measures related with the construction and renovation of buildings as well as the \\nconstruction of Photovoltaic systems will c ontribute substantially to creating green jobs. Reduced \\ndependence on energy imports will not only contribute to improving the security of energy supply but \\nalso to macroeconomic and political security of the country through decreasing the domestic budget \\ndeficit. \\nEnvironmental context:  \\nAlbania’s energy policies pursue three objectives:  \\ni) support for the overall economic development,  \\nii) increase of the security of energy supply,  \\niii) protection of environment. \\nRenewable energy especially other than hydro is a solution for decreasing the strategic dependence on \\nenergy imports and mitigating the impact of climate change resulting in unreliable hydropower \\nproduction. However, there are conflicts of interest with environmental protection goals, which must be \\nhandled properly. \\nSocial context:  \\nThe increase of employment mainly through investments in the energy and building sector led to the \\nincrease of the personal/families revenues followed by the increase of living standard of the society. \\nThere is a strong connection between personal and society welfare which means that investments create \\nnot only jobs but they have their impact on municipalities and governmental revenues through taxes, \\nfees, etc and their use in budgeting forms to be spent for purposes such as health, education, etc.  \\nSpecifically, targets on Energy Efficiency aim at the reduction of energy consumption per unit and thus \\nat a contribution to affordable energy supply and reducing the poverty.  \\n \\n1.1.2 Strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union \\nThe five dimensions of the Energy Union are: (i) energy security; (ii) the internal energy market;  (iii) \\nenergy efficiency (iv) decarbonisation; and (v) research, innovation and competitiveness. \\nThe strategy relating to the five dimensions of the Energy Union rests on four pillars:  \\n(1) To discuss and review sectoral targets, policies and measures in order to identify gaps and \\nsynergies, especially with regard to alleviating energy poverty and providing affordable energy for \\npeople, and with regard to job creation. Therefore, an important focus is on financing measures.   \\n(2) To make high -quality quantitative data available as far as possible. They must be provided in \\ndetail as much as possible to support the process of analyzing and getting results needed for in-depth \\nanalyses, planning and monitoring in different energy-related sectors.  \\n                                                      \\n1So far this role is being carried by the NANR. It has not been defined yet which is the agency that will permanently \\ntake over its responsibilities. '),\n",

This is a general concern and therefore \\nalso applies to, but is not limited to, the development of the NECP.  \\n(4) To create awareness and acceptance of the NECP among all stakeholder groups by organising \\npublic information and consultation procedures. \\nThe basis for this is the establishment of a coordination structure and a coordination procedure across \\ndifferent ministries and departments playing a role in the five dimensions of the Energy Union.   \\nThe Inter -Ministerial Energy and Climate Committee (IECC)  has been established to ensure that \\ndeveloped targets, policies and measures will be feasible and realistic in terms of implementation and \\nexpected impact at national level.  \\nThe development of the NECP is regarded as an open-ended management process based on continuous \\nimprovement. Especially the situation regarding data availability is challenging and has been identified \\nas high priority field of action in order to improve future versions of the NECP.  \\n \\n1.1.3 Overview table with key objectives, policies and measures of the plan \\nAn overview table with key policies and measures is provided in chapter 3 ( Table 11: Overview table \\nof key policies affecting the national climate target to 2030). The analytical basis of the NECP (chapters \\n4 and 5) explains that targets are influenced mainly by the mode of operation of renewable plants, the \\nreduction of fossil fuel use in transport and industry by fuel switch and energy efficiency measures \\ntargeting the building sector. Furthermore, forestry management has a major influence.     \\nTargets to be achieved by 2030 are presented in the table below.  \\n \\nTargets (2030) and reference  Sector contribution \\nGHG emission savings ( Reduction relat. \\nWEM) \\n-18.7%  \\n GHG emissions [kt CO2eq] as projected \\nwith additional measures for 2030 \\nDemand 4833.0 \\nTransformation 250.8 \\nNon Energy 5139.0 \\n More details see \\nchapter 5, Table 36 \\nEnergy Efficiency (Final Energy \\nConsumption reduction relat.

Plans to increase the use of natural gas must be carefully developed and aligned with other \\nplans, to ensure that GHG and final energy reduction targets and EE improvement targets will be \\nachieved. \\nAlbania depends almost exclusively on hydropower for its electricity generation (98% of its electricity \\ngeneration comes from hydropower), making it increasingly vulnerable to unfavourable hydrological \\nconditions in the summer, especially in view to predicted effects of climate change in the Western \\nBalkans region. Apart from the fact that there is no constant production, electricity from hydropower is \\nnot sufficient to meet the needs. Albania is a net importer of electricity and ensuring the security of its \\npower supply is a challenge. Thus, Albania started to plan adequate measures to increase investments in \\nrenewable energy projects other than hydropower. Due to the fall in technology costs and significant \\nrenewable energy potential that the country has, wind and solar PV can be deployed cost-effectively to \\nmitigate the impact on the end-consumer electricity price. By the end of 2018, there were additional 10 \\nMW of solar PV installed.  \\nFor the years 2019 -2020, the Consolidated Renewable Energy Action Plan  foresees the expansion of \\ninstalled electricity generators based on renewable sources by 738 MW, as follows: 57 MW of \\nhydropower energy; 490 MW of photovoltaic energy; 150 MW of wind energy; 41 MW of MNU (waste \\nto energy). The related additional potential for renewable generation in Albania is estimated 1761 GWh. \\n(Source: The Consolidated Renewable Energy Action Plan 2019 - 2020)   \\nHowever, especially regarding concession contracts to build and operate HPP, doubts have been \\nexpressed about the quality of SEAs and EIAs carried out on energy projects. Overall, implementation \\nof energy projects lags far behind schedule which needs to be addressed in strategic planning.

This is due to a failure in the plant’s cooling system that has not been repaired. \\nThe conversion of the Vlora power plant from oil use to gas use once it is co nnected to the T AP is \\nencouraged.

However, this will increase gas consumption and thus also CO2 emissions and \\nmust be taken into account accordingly in strategic planning. \\n \\nStructure of the Albanian energy system \\nIn a graphical way, we are introducing the structure of the Albanian energy system: \\nIn terms of Gross inland consumption (to be confirmed) 2019, the Albanian energy system has been \\ndominated and still continues to be dominated by oil by products for transport use (appr. 53.3%), \\nfollowed by electricity produced from hydropower (appr. 28.17%), and in the third place is biomass \\n(fuelwood, appr. 6.8%) used for heating, cooking and domestic  hot water. Fuelwood is mostly used in \\nhousehold (rural areas) and in the service sector (Figure 1). \\n \\nFigure 1: Gross Inland Consumption (ktoe) (Source: Albanian Energy Balances)  \\n \\n-500.00\\n0.00\\n500.00\\n1000.00\\n1500.00\\n2000.00\\n2500.00\\n3000.00\\n3500.00\\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\\nGross Inland Consumption (Ktoe)\\nPrimary production Net Import Stock change Bunkers'),\n",

The \\nsystem must rely on domestic production and being affordable for consumers by creating an impact on \\npoverty reduction.  \\nFigure 2 shows the import dependence of the energy system. The share of import in percentage of the \\nGross Inland Consumption is high, thus affecting the security of supply.

The Albanian Constitution it self has included “a healthy and \\necologically adequate environment for present and future generation” as one of the social objectives that \\nneed to be taken into consideration by all state institutions.  \\nAlbania is a signatory to the United Nations Framewor k Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), \\nadopted at the “Rio Earth Summit” in 1992 and ratified by the Albanian Parliament in 1994, which \\nestablished the objective to combat climate change by stabilizing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere \\nand limiting av erage global temperature increases to support sustainable development. Albania has \\nstarted the process of changing the status from a developing country to a developed country, in the \\ncontext of the UNFCCC. This process is an integral part of the process of  integration into the EU and \\ninvolves the development of capacities at the national level for monitoring and annual reporting of \\nGreenhouse Gases (GHG), the formulation and implementation of policies for GHG emission reduction \\nand climate change adaptation, and the transposition and implementation of the E U Acquis on climate \\nchange. In order to achieve the emission reduction objectives, the Paris Agreement adopted in December \\n2015 and ratified by the Albanian Parliament through law No. 75/2016 dated 14.07.2016, establishes a \\n“bottom up system” where Parties have to prepare and communicate successive nationally determined \\ncontributions (NDC) every five years with the aim of progressively improving their efforts. In addition \\nto their NDC, Parties should also f ormulate long-term, mid-century low GHG development strategies, \\nand submit them by 2020 that demonstrate how their efforts will contribute to the goal of zero -net \\nemissions by the second half of this century.   \\nThe next NDC update is due by 2020, and the N ECP development process should be in line with the \\nNDC update process.  \\nIn 2014 the Order of the Prime Minister No. 155, dated 25.04.2014 established an inter -ministerial \\nworking group on the coordination of the Ministries tasks, according to the country’s  obligations on \\nUNFCCC. The group, chaired by the Deputy Minister of Environment, includes the representatives of \\n12 Albanian Ministries. The group has the mandate, among others, to draft policies and strategies, and \\nto ensure inter-institutional coordination for the implementation of climate change activities.  \\nEnergy and Climate Acquis of the Energy Community  \\nAlthough Albania is making progress with transposing and implementing the Acquis, crucial points \\nremain:  \\n\\uf0b7 the reliability of the energy database and the need for macro-economic data in much more detail \\nin order to improve analyses, in-depth reviews and monitoring of the action plans and strategies \\nrelated with energy; \\n\\uf0b7 the low implementation of legislation and strategic documents; \\n\\uf0b7 the need for a financial framework for implementing policy measures.

To avoid this risk, setting up financing \\nmechanisms for NECP implementation is the key to success. In view of the very high investment costs \\nand the long periods of time required to realise investments across the energy sector, strategic \\ninvestments in RES and RE are becoming key issues in terms of increasing security of supply, reducing \\nemissions and adapting energy demand on the basis of least cost planning.  \\nTransposition of EU Directives under the Energy Community Acquis \\nInformation about the status of transposition and implementation of Directiv es is provided in the \\nchapters of the respective Dimension. Albania has prepared and adopted a number of policy documents, \\nstrategies and action plans aligned with the Energy and Climate Acquis of the Energy Community.  \\nThe main energy-related policy documents are described below:  \\n\\uf0b7 National Sector Strategy for Energy 2018-2030, approved by DCM No. 480 dated 31.7.2018 is \\nthe core strategic document for the country’s energy sector clearly defining national energy \\ntargets until 2030. \\n\\uf0b7 Strategic Plan for Reform in Energy Sector in Albania (2018 -2020), approved by DCM No. \\n742, dated 12.12.2018, is a roadmap for reforming the entire electricity sector in Albania. It is \\nthe basis for the Policy-Based Loan (PBL) for the implementation of the specific Policy Reforms \\nElements (18 PREs) listed in this Strategic Plan. \\n\\uf0b7 Albania’s Economic Reform Programme (2020-2022) related to energy sector reforms includes \\nthe following: (i) Effective liberalization of the energy market, with complete u nbundling and \\na functioning power exchange; (ii) Implementation of the law on renewable energy sources; (iii) \\nAdoption of the secondary legislation for the laws on energy efficiency and the energy \\nperformance of buildings. \\n\\uf0b7 NEEAP 2nd and 3rd has set up some objectives and targets up to 2020, EE measures, investments \\nand responsible institutions.  \\n\\uf0b7 National Consolidated Renewable Energy Action Plan (NCREAP 2019 – 2020) approved by \\nDCM No. 580 dated 31.7.2018, foresees an average increase of electricity generators from \\nrenewable sources of 738 MW out of which 490 MW from photovoltaic (PV) and 150 MW \\nfrom Wind Power. \\n \\n1.2.2 Current energy and climate policies and measures relating to the five dimensions of the \\nEnergy Union \\nOverview of key policies  \\nNational Energy Strategy for Albania  \\nThe Energy Strategy for Albania 2018 -2030, as the core strategic document for the country’s energy \\nsector, is fully coherent with other national policies and strategies  and the European Green Deal’s \\nobjectives: Supplying clean, affordable and secure energy; Building and renovating, promoting a cleaner \\nconstruction sector; Accelerating the shift to sustainable and smart mobil ity; Eliminating pollution  \\nthrough measures to cut pollution rapidly and efficiently.  \\nThe five dimensions which the energy strategy supports are: \\n1. Energy security, based on diversification of energy resources; \\n2. Full integration in the regional market and later to the European one; \\n3. Energy efficiency which contributes to the moderation of demand; \\n4. Decarbonization of the economy; \\n5. Research, innovation and competition '),\n",

As the analyses supporting this \\nstrategy shows, there is significantly greater GHG reduction potential in the Albanian energy system \\nthan the initial NDC commitment. Therefore, the energy strategy and the policy objectives it envisions \\nare in-line with the increasing ambition goals of both the UNFCCC and the EU/Energy Community. \\nGiven the current status of Albania as a candidate country in accession to the EU, it is likely during the \\nperiod covered by this strategy Albania will accede to the EU. For this reason, as well as required by its \\nEnergy Community membership, it is of great importance that the Energy Strategy is in line also with \\nEU Climate Change Policy by ensuring that the energy policy objectives and the respective energy \\naction plans identified in this document are supporting the levels of ambition expressed in EU CO 2 \\nreduction targets and climate change political goals. \\nThe figure below shows other key policies in the form of an overview.

In \\naddition to MIE and ERE there are a number of ministries that have a smaller role in the sector, and also \\na number of government agencies with responsibilities with respect to the power sector that are \\ndelegated to them by the minist ries. These are: Ministry of Finance and Economy (“MFE”), Ministry \\nfor Health and Social Welfare, Ministry of Tourism and Environment (\"MTE\") and  government \\nagencies and companies involved in energy supply, as shown in the figure below.

This reduction is equivalent to a CO 2 emission reduction of 708 \\nGg by 2030. The emission trajectory of Albania allows a smooth trend for achieving 2 tons o f GHG \\nemissions per capita by 2050, which can be taken as a target for global contraction and convergence of \\ngreenhouse gas emissions. \\nThe main mechanisms of achieving this objective are related to maintaining the low -level greenhouse \\ngases emissions from energy production sector and developing low carbon policies in order to prevent \\nthe increase of greenhouse gases emissions from other sectors of the economy.    \\nAll sectors need to contribute to the low-carbon transition according to their technological and economic \\npotential.

During 2018, 60 \\nbuildings have been selected representing all the identified typologies, providing the \\nnecessary information to draft energy efficiency policies taking cost effectiveness into \\naccount. \\n\\uf0b7 The project for improving the Energy Efficiency in the Student City 2 has been completed and \\nin some buildings in Student City 1.  \\n\\uf0b7 The Municipality of Tirana has developed projects to improve the energy efficiency by \\ninterfering with the facade of several private buildings. These projects are carried out with the \\ninvestment of jo intly, 50% from the fund of the Municipality of Tirana and 50% from the \\nresidents.  \\n\\uf0b7 In the transport sector, measures for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of some streets help \\nto reduce the fuel consumption of the vehicles. Increasing the use of bicycles and increasing the \\nshare of public transport has facilitated to reduce the use of private vehicles. A tax was induced \\nto promote the use of new and less fuel consuming vehicle causing less emissions. Nevertheless, \\nEE measures must be significantly expanded.  \\n\\uf0b7 Little progress was achieved in the industry sector. The need for the improvement of the EE law \\nconcerns the obligation schemes and energy audits as a key element for identification of the \\nactual energy consumption and energy targeted to be consumed after investing in EE measures \\nimplementation. \\n \\nRecently, AEE issued the 4th annual report with some new findings: \\n\\uf0b7 The most important activity of this year was the certification of the first energy efficiency \\nauditors.

Qualitative indicators are displayed below. \\n1.  Gas supply framework \\nThe existing gas network is outdated and mostly non-operational. Its domestic natural gas production is \\nmarginal, of which the majority is consumed for own use in oil production and by the refining industry. \\nOn hydrocarbons, Albania has not aligned its legislation with the Hydrocarbons Licensing Directive, \\nbut there has been some progress with its secondary legislation. The Directive on safety of offshore oil \\nand gas installations has not been transposed. In February 2018, the Albanian government adopted the \\n‘gas master plan’, which assesses investment needs until 2040. In May 2018, Albgaz SA, the combined \\ngas operator in Albania, was admitted as an observer at the European Network of Transmission System \\nOperators for Gas. Albgaz should continue with permanent capacity building to be prepared for \\noperation of future gas infrastructure. \\n2. Electricity supply framework \\nIn the coming years, Albania should in particular pursue the transition process towards diversification \\naway from hydropower and promote alternative sources of renewable energy while complying with \\nenvironmental standards. \\n3. Emergency and crisis management system and demand restraint programs \\nAlbania’s oil-stock legislation is not in line with the Acquis. There was no progress in creating a central \\nstockholding body for oil.

Energy \\nThe national energy strategy 2018-2030 was adopted in 2018. The gas master plan was adopted by the \\ngovernment in February 2018. Further efforts need to be made to adopt the SEA and project \\nidentification plan related to the gas master plan. Adoption of this SEA and plan will help the \\ndevelopment of TEN -E projects. Progress was made on im proving the infrastructure for power \\ntransmission. The trans -Adriatic pipeline is progressing on schedule, with 84.1% of the project \\ncompleted by the end of 2018. The pipeline is expected to be operational in 2020. Major gas \\ninterconnector projects are provided for under the gas master plan. \\nHowever, Albania failed to transpose and implement the Regulation (EU) 347/2013 on guidelines for \\ntrans-European energy infrastructure by 1 January 2017, and in November 2018 the Ministerial Council \\nof the Energy Community adopted a decision establishing a breach of Albania’s obligations under the \\nEnergy Community Treaty. \\n \\nDimension Internal Energy Market \\nOn the internal energy market, Albania has adopted legislation on gas and electricity in line with the \\nEU’s Third energy package.  \\nIn March 2017, the Albanian Energy Regulator Entity (ERE) approved the certification of OST SA as \\nthe transmission system operator, following a positive opinion from the Energy Community Secretariat. \\nThe ENTSO-E assembly therefore admitted OST SA as a full member of the network. Progress has been \\nachieved in the legal unbundling of the distribution-system operator OSHEE SA from its supply activity. \\nElectricity prices are still regulated but should be gradually liberalised. On May 2019, the Government \\nof Albania adopted a decision to establish a power exchange, with day-ahead and intraday markets. The \\nelectricity market remains closed by a regulated c ontract between state-owned generation and supply \\ncompanies.  \\n \\nPower Sector  \\nThe Power Sector Law deregulated the prices for electricity generation and wholesale in 2015. However, \\nthe wholesale market is not yet fully liberalized. The distribution system operator and supplier OSHEE \\nis still obliged to buy all the electricity that is required to supply customers under universal service and \\ncover losses in the distribution system from the generation company KESH under an exclusive mutual \\ncontract and regulated conditions, based on the Council of Ministers’ Decision on public services in the \\nelectricity sector. This is in breach of the Energy Community Acquis and represents a major obstacle to \\nthe development of competition in the wholesale market in Albania. T he contract between KESH and \\nOSHEE was prolonged in March 2019, however, without the approval of ERE.  \\nAlbania’s electricity sector is characterized by a market structure in which most of the energy \\nprocurement is dominated by bilateral transactions for la rge customers, while most of the other \\ncustomers and the retail market remains operated under a regulatory regime. Positively, the unbundling \\nof operations and interests is underway, and the one positive aspect in the transmission ownership was \\nadopted by law in 2016. \\nThe Market Rules for operation of the electricity market following the Market Model and including \\norganized day-ahead and intraday functions were adopted by ERE in December 2017. Also, a law for a \\nmarket-based procurement of balancing was approved. \\n \\nThe figure below shows Albania’s electricity market scheme as of July 2020. '),\n",

The Council of Ministers decided on the \\nestablishment of APEX, as a separate legal entity established by the transmission system operator OST \\nwith initial capital fully financed by this company, in May 2019. The Decision also provides for the \\npossible entry of shareholders other than OST through a competitive procedure and outlines the domain \\nof shareholders and structure of the capital. In its related Decision of 11 September 2019, the Council \\ndefined the detailed procedure for the selection of shareholders in APEX and allocated responsibilities \\nto the relevant ministries and the selection committee. The Council defined the bidding and selection \\ncriteria, procedures, and requirements for each individual category of potential bidders from the EU and \\nthe Energy Community, including transmission system operators, international market operators, market \\nparticipants and international financial institutions. The minister responsible for energy shall initiate the \\ncompetitive selection procedure however the deadline for its initiation is not defined. \\nThe Market Rules for operation of the electricity market following the Market Model and including \\norganized day -ahead and intraday functions were adopted by ERE in December 2017, their full \\nimplementation being conditioned by the establishment of APEX. \\nThe final balancing rules that would allow for the full implementation of the requirements of the Law \\nfor a market -based procurement of balancing services have not yet been adopted. The transitional \\nbalancing rules, adopted  by ERE in November 2017, are still in force. Imbalances are settled using \\nreference hourly prices from the Hungarian day-ahead market. Although the rules allow new entrants to \\nthe balancing market and potential balancing service providers are available, K ESH is still the sole \\nprovider. The Law and the Market Model support the possibility for the transmission system operator \\nto exchange balancing services, under market-based conditions, across the borders. This possibility has \\nnot been implemented yet.  The figure below shows the implementation by electricity indicators as \\ncalculated and compiled by the Energy Community Secretariat. \\n'),\n",

As a result, most of the customers remain at regulated prices, except for a \\npart of the 35 kV customers.

All customers are allowed to choose and switch their gas supplier freely.  \\nHousehold customers and small enterprises are entitled to regula ted gas supplies under public service \\nobligations and the supply of last resort is foreseen for all customers. The majority of requirements under \\nDirective 2009/73/EC with regard to customer protection and vulnerable customers were transposed by \\nthe Law. However, the criteria and procedures for determining who qualifies as a vulnerable customer \\nare yet to be adopted by the Council of Ministers. The Natural Gas Emergency Plan was adopted by the \\nGovernment with the Energy Community Secretariat’s assistance. \\nGeneral rules on procedures for switching of the natural gas supplier and general conditions for the \\nsupply of natural gas were adopted by the ERE in July 2018 in line with the Third Energy Package. \\nThe Gas Law of 2015 set the unbundling requirements which are in line with the Third Energy Package. \\nSubsequently adopted certification rules have supplemented these provisions in a proper manner. \\nBoth transmission system operators – Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) AG, operator of the TAP in Albania \\nand Albgaz, the state-owned transmission and distribution system operator, are certified. \\nCompliance issues with Albgaz’s certification decision procedure were the main discussion point in \\n2018/2019, in particular with regards to the proper separation within the State.

In the absence of a clear separation \\nof duties between AKBN and INSTAT, the former began collecting data in cooperation with ERE. \\nAKBN is collecting and disseminating data on electricity prices charged to households. Dat a linked to \\nnatural gas is not relevant for Albania yet. Nevertheless, the set of compiled data is still incomplete. \\nPrices charged to industrial end-users are not available yet. \\nIn addition, the breakdown of electricity prices into main components, as required by the Regulation, is \\nnot compiled and transmitted to EUROSTAT. The missing datasets include price components charged \\nto both household and non-household customers. Currently, Albania is the only Contracting Party failing \\nto report end-user prices charged to non-household customers. \\nThe statistics on end-user prices charged to non-household customers (industry) and the breakdown of \\nprices, both household and non-household, into price components are not complete and do not comply \\nwith Regulation (EU) 2016/1952. \\nGas Sector '),\n",

According to this Decision, the natural gas transmission tariff will be the same until \\n31.03.2019. \\nIn 2019, ERE started the procedures for the adoption of the “grid code harmonizing tariff structures for \\ngas transmission”, through the Decision of Board of Commissioners of ERE No. 168 dated 4.11.2019 \\n“On the initiation of the procedure for the adoption of the “grid code harmonizing tariff structures for \\ngas transmission”. \\nEnergy poverty \\nAlbania provides access to electricity for the entire population, through a process completed before the \\ntransition period in the 90’s. Albania has succeeded to provide universal access to all its citizens and the \\ncountry relies on domestic electricity production which is based primarily in clean hydropower energy. \\nThe substantial investments in the energy sector over the recent years have improved significantly the \\nquality of electricity supply and attracted the interest of private sector participation, includi ng notable \\ninternational companies, to develop electricity production plants. The electricity grid constantly expands \\nand upgrades to meet the increased demand and new connections. Substantial improvements have been \\nachieved over the recent years in the collection of electricity bills, resulting in an improved performance \\nof the public companies operating the core of the energy sector.  \\nDespite the improvements and the advantage on relying on clean energy sources, the country should \\nfocus further on the affordable aspect of this target as the electricity prices are relatively high compared \\nto regional level. The Albanian Law on the Power Sector (OG 43/2015) defines a vulnerable customer \\n(Article 3) as a household consumer who due to social reasons, in specia l conditions and by definition \\nof this law, is entitled to certain special rights regarding the supply of electricity. The vulnerability \\ncriteria are, according to Article 95, determined by the Ministry of Social Affairs in cooperation with \\nthe Ministry fo r Energy and Ministry of Finance together with the state Energy Regulatory Entity. \\nVulnerability is addressed through different energy and social policies in accordance with the Social \\nStrategy in the Energy Community (2013). \\nHowever, Energy poverty as such is not yet clearly defined and systematically monitored. There are no \\nspecific policies in place designed to alleviate energy poverty. “Energy poverty, in general terms, \\nrepresents the inability of a household to secure adequate amounts of energy in the home – allowing it \\nto keep living spaces adequately warm and well lit, to have access to a needed range of energy services, \\nand to be able to afford a sufficient amount of energy for everyday requirements.”9 \\n \\nAssessment of policies and measures shows that Albania has adopted legislation on gas and electricity \\nin line with the EU’s third energy package. The new national energy strategy 2018 -2030 has been \\nadopted. There was progress in the gas sector and on interconnection lines. \\n1. Unbundling and third-party access rules \\nAlbania has to finalize the unbundling of energy companies and abolish legal obstacles to the right of \\ncustomers to change their electricity supplier. \\nIn March 2017, the Albanian Energy Regulator Entity (ERE) approved the certification of OST  SA as \\nthe transmission system operator, following a positive opinion from the Energy Community Secretariat. \\n                                                      \\n9 Energy Poverty in South East Europe – Surviving the Cold.

However, ERE \\nalso imposed conditions on OST SA in the final certification decisions. These conditions concerned the \\ntransfer of investment tasks to the new public body owner of the TSO. These conditions have not yet \\nbeen met, and the deadline for meeting them has been postponed for three years. \\nSome progress has been achi eved in the legal unbundling of the distribution -system operator OSHEE \\nSA from its supply activity. This was achieved by the establishment of three new companies. \\nERE’s legal framework is to a prevailing extent in line with the acquis except for a few but central \\nmissing competences, namely the right to impose measures to promote competition, to require \\ntransmission and distribution system operators to change their terms and conditions and to raise the \\npenalty level ERE is entitled to impose. On the practical side ERE should develop into a well-equipped \\nand skilled independent institution that addresses shortcomings in the national energy markets more \\nactively. \\n2.  Harmonization of market rules on a regional level \\nThe country has delayed electricity market r eforms and should accelerate implementation of the \\nconnectivity reform measures, especially by removing legal and contractual obstacles to the integration \\nof energy markets. The country has to establish an organized day-ahead electricity market. \\nElectricity prices are still regulated but should be gradually liberalized once legislation is implemented. \\nThe freedom for all customers to switch suppliers is effectively prevented by amendments to the Power \\nSector Law; implementation is still lacking since most customers connected to 35kV are allowed to buy \\nsupply of last resort, and all connected to lower voltage level – by universal service supplier. The \\nelectricity market remains closed by a regulated contract between state -owned generation and supply \\ncompanies. This contract must be terminated urgently. \\n3. Interconnection congestion and reliability management \\nAlbania is not connected to international gas networks. \\nAlbania’s electricity system has been interconnected with the neighboring systems of Greece and \\nMontenegro since 2014, when the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO -E) \\napproved synchronous operation of the Albanian electricity transmission system with the continental \\nEuropean system. \\nIt also has a power interconnection line with Kosovo. The 400 kV interconnection line between Albania \\nand Kosovo was completed in June 2016. \\nAlbania also participates in the EU’s macro -regional strategy for the Adriatic and Ionian region \\n(EUSAIR), for which the improvement of connectivity (transport and energy networks) is a main \\npriority. \\nTrans-European networks \\nAlbania has some level of preparation in the area of trans-European networks. Some progress was made \\nin developing transport and energy networks. Some progress was made on its gas interconnection with \\nthe implementation of the trans-Adriatic pipeline project.  \\nIn the coming years, Albania should in particular: \\n\\uf0b7 continue development of the core transport and energy networks in line with: \\n(i) the national strategies for transport and energy; \\n(ii) the infrastructure investment prioritization under the single project pipeline; and \\n(iii) the connectivity agenda; \\n\\uf0b7 harmonize the legal framework with the EU Acquis and the regulations on TEN -T (trans \\nEuropean transport networks) and TEN -E (trans -European energy networks ), including \\ntransposition of Regulation (EU) 347/2013 on guidelines for trans -European energy '),\n",

Albania \\nparticipates actively in the South -east Europe Transport Observatory (which was replaced by the \\nTransport Community Treaty in January 2019) and Western Balkans 6 (WB6) processes, focusing on \\nimproving connectivity within the WB6 and with the EU. The national transport strategy and action plan \\nfor 2016-2020 envisages an extension of the TEN-T Comprehensive and Core Networks to Albania and \\nan alignment with TEN-T guidelines and EU standards and regulations. There was progress in drafting \\nthe second review of the Albanian national transport plan (ANTP3), which was completed in January \\n2019. \\nAlbania has made progress in repairing its road infrastructure in the core network. Albania is progressing \\nwith the preparation of road and rail infrastructure projects, especially along the Adriatic-Ionian corridor \\nand corridor VIII. Upgrading of the railway from Durres to Tirana is planned to start by mid of 2019. \\nAlbania needs to ensure that its transport network projects are impl emented in line with the TEN -T \\nregulatory framework. Future infrastructure investments need to be implemented in compliance with \\nEU standards on public procurement, state aid, and EIAs. Projects should be channelled through a single \\nproject pipeline, confirming the country’s strategic orientation towards TENs. Further efforts are needed \\non road safety. More serious measures should be taken to fix ‘blackspots’ along sections of roads with \\nhigh accident rates. Adoption of the multiannual maintenance plans for the entire core network (rail and \\nroad) remains a challenge. \\nAlbania is partially aligned with the Acquis on a single European railway area, railway system \\ninteroperability and rail freight corridors for competitive freight. \\n Further efforts are needed to: \\n(i) align the country with the Directive on intelligent transport systems, \\n(ii) develop the national strategy for intelligent transport systems (ITS); and \\n(iii) prepare for implementation of that strategy. \\n \\nDimension Research, Innovation and Competitiveness \\nThe legal b asis for Research and Innovation is the National Strategy for Science, Technology and \\nInnovation DCM No. 710 dated 1.12.2017.   \\nNational objectives:  \\n\\uf0b7 Reforming the institutional system of scientific research \\n\\uf0b7 Increased investment in research and innovation with public funds and other alternative sources \\nat 1% of GDP in 2022 \\n\\uf0b7 Involvement of the Albanian scientific diaspora in science, technology and innovation  \\n\\uf0b7 Increasing cooperation between the scientific community and business 2017-2022   \\n\\uf0b7 Evaluation of scientific research quality \\nSupport for universities and other research-oriented entities is regulated in the following documents:  \\n\\uf0b7 REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA, COUNCIL OF MINISTERS - National Strategy for Development \\nand Integration 2014-2020  pp 72 \\n\\uf0b7 DCM No. 710 dated 1.12.2017 National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation   \\n\\uf0b7 COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT Albania 2019 Report Accompanying the \\ndocument Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the \\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee and (chapter 15 Energy pp.74) '),\n",

In this regard, it \\nis essential to exchange exper ience and collaborate on the development of strategies, in order to align \\neconomically important decisions.  \\nAnother crucial sector of cross -border relevance is the transport sector. The present “National Sector \\nStrategy for Transport 2016 -2020” has been a ligned with the National Strategy for Development and \\nIntegration which defines Albania’s vision for its national social, democratic and economic development \\nover the period 2015 -2020. The development and modernization of Albania’s transport infrastructure  \\nhas been and remains one of the top priorities of the GoA. The aim has been: \\n\\uf0b7 to create the preconditions for the development of other sectors of the economy, \\n\\uf0b7 to increase the accessibility of freight and passengers in trade and service delivery, and  \\n\\uf0b7 to significantly contribute to overall economic growth and development of the economy.  \\nThe strategic priority is to accelerate the integration of Albania’s transport system and the establishment \\nof an integrated market comprised of transport infrastructure by land (road and rail), by sea and by inland \\nwaterways. Despite significant investments especially in improving road infrastructure, the transport \\nsector has yet to become a significant promoter of economic development in Albania. The timely and \\nadequate funding of annual and medium -term programme investments remains problematic. Further, \\nthe quality of transport related public works is still not yet up to EU standards. Aligning Albania’s \\ntransport policy with the European Transport Policy and coordinati ng its transport infrastructure with \\nits neighboring countries – the Western Balkans countries comprising Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, \\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Montenegro, Serbia, and Kosovo - have \\nbecome two must-do’s for Albania’s transport decision-makers.10 \\n                                                      \\n10 Sectorial Strategy of Transport & Action Plan 2016 – 2020, First Monitoring Report, No . 811, dated 16th \\nNovember 2016 '),\n",

The National Energy  \\nStrategy has set a target of 42% in TPES and 15% reduction of energy use compared to the baseline for \\n2030. The modelling underlying the strategy differs in GDP growth and population. The RE target of \\nthe National Energy Strategy uses efficiencies of 78% and less for renewable power generation, which \\nupscales the renewable share in TPES. In final energy, the NECP also achieves a higher RES share. On \\nsectoral level, the National Energy Strategy does not consider the strong renovation projected by SLED \\n(2015) and adopted by the NECP. It uses biomass pellets for space heating, while the NECP builds on \\nelectrification and renovation. In Services, the National Energy Strategy projects a strong increase in \\nenergy demand. In transport, it does not consider electri fication, while transmission grid losses are \\nunderestimated. A large difference is seen in the uptake of natural gas, which is used to meet 20% of \\nfinal energy demand in 2030 in the National Energy Strategy overall and used in many subsectors, from \\nminor use cases in industry today. Despite these differences, the comparison with the National Energy \\nStrategy proved a very useful and insightful reference to the work underlying the NECP.  \\nThe NDC of Albania was submitted in 2015 and covered the energy sector o nly. In parallel to the \\nelaboration of the NECP, the revision of the NDC was undertaken by a separate team, aiming to also \\ncover the full economy. The Governance regulation foresees that the NECP takes precedence over the \\nNDC. The activity underlying the elaboration of the NDC was nonetheless carried out in parallel, despite \\nseveral attempts to harmonize and align efforts. From the material provided by the NDC team, it was \\npossible to improve the scope of PaMs underlying the non-energy sectors, while the estimates of effects \\nhave been elaborated separately. The estimate underlying the LULUCF sector of the NECP have been \\ntaken from the NDC. The energy sector estimates of the NDC are reportedly based on the National \\nEnergy Strategy, with a limited update to the modelling underlying this document. The differences with \\nthis document and the underlying modelling have been discussed above. \\n \\nPreliminary note on the National Energy Strategy  \\nThe National Energy Strategy (NSE) 2018-203013 is an overall energy sector strategy and was thus the \\nmain policy document in the energy sector, serving as input to the Dimensions 1-4 of the Energy Union \\nand Albania’s NECP. NSE (page 107) estimates that the contribution of public investments is equal t o \\n252 MEur for the period 2018 -2030, mainly for supporting awareness campaigns and pilot projects to \\npromote EE in all economic sectors. Private investment and donor financing are estimated with 3,399 \\nMEur for the period 2018-2030.  \\nWith regard to the Dime nsions Decarbonisation and Energy Efficiency, the targets of the NSE have \\nbeen adjusted based on the evolving knowledge base.  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n                                                      \\n13Approved by DCM No. 480, dated 31.7.2018 based on law no. 43/2015, “On power sector”.

Unless the fact \\nthat Albania is rated as one of Europe’s richest countries in onshore hydrocarbon reserves, very little \\nhas been done for increasing productivity and technological improvements which was therefore \\nintegrated in the NECP. \\nThe objective to shift the existing road tran sport to other transport modalities, like the rail or water \\ntransport will contribute to reduce fuel consumption.  \\nThe goal for the share of the bio-fuels vs. total fuel consumption in transport sector 10% in 2020, 10% \\nin 2025 and 10% in 2030 as compared t o 3.55% in 2015 will also contribute to reduce fossil fuel \\nconsumption in transport. \\n \\n2.3.4 National objectives with regard to increasing flexibility  \\nThe national targets for 2030 about increasing the contribution of primary energy sources, increasing of \\nrenewable energy production, increasing of natural gas penetration, development of diverse supply \\nsources through new investments, increasing regional cooperation and integration and interconnection \\nwith regional and European electricity and natural gas networks, integration of the Albanian electricity \\nand natural gas market with Kosovo, enhancing security of energy transmission and supply through \\ndiversification of supply routes of energy and improving the security and the reliability of them through \\ncost-effectiveness investments shall increase the flexibility of the national energy system. \\nThe Master Plan of Natural Gas for Albania was approved by DCM No. 87 of 14.02.2018 and aims to \\ndevelop a sustainable natural gas system that enables a balanced contribution to the energy system, \\nensuring gas supply through competition and environmental protection. A completely new gas \\ntransmission and distribution system is n eeded. In 2040, the potential consumption of natural gas for \\nelectricity generation could be around 770 million m³, while the projected consumption at the country's \\nrefineries could be around 89.2 million m³. Priority projects identified in the Master Plan  of Gas for \\nAlbania are described in chapter 3 of the NECP draft document.  \\nExpansion of new generation capacity is planned in the future: some new large HPP as Devolli River \\nCascade, Fan River Cascade, some small power plants which are under construction,  two new thermo \\npower stations in Korça , Kuçova, etc. also shall contribute to increasing the flexibility of the national \\nenergy system. \\n \\n \\n2.4 Dimension Internal energy market \\n \\nThe objective of internal energy market is to harmonize and liberalize the country’ s internal energy \\nmarket, to address market access, transparency and regulation, consumer protection, supporting \\ninterconnection, and adequate levels of supply. \"),\n",

The most important effects are presented subsequently ordered by sector. \\nResidential sector \\nThe household size is decreasing from on average 3.9 persons per household in 2012 to 3.4 persons per \\nhousehold in 2030 and then decreasing further to 3.2 in 2040 (Statistical Database 2021). The floor area \\nper person is considered to increase from 43.4m² in 2012 to 46.6 m² in 2018 and 52.6 m³ in 2030. It \\nfurther increases to 59.2m² in 2040. Overall, total floor area increases from 125.7 Million m² in 2012 to \\n145 Million m² in 2030 and further to 154 Million m² in 2040 despite the decrease in population. Figure \\n21 shows the development of building age classes based on SLED (2015), which is assumed as \\nprojection here. The reconstruction rate is high, leading to a share of 37% of  floor area by 2040 that is \\nbuilt or refurbished after 2015. The strongest deconstruction is seen in buildings built between 1961 and \\n1990. \\n \\n \\nFigure 21: Floor area development by year of construction.

The strongest increase is seen in \\napartment buildings, rising from 28.1% in 2012 to 32.5% in 2040.  \\nThe impact of the change in housing composition decreases energy intensity due to lower energy \\nconsumption per floor area in apartment buildings th an in smaller building types. Figure 22 shows the \\ndevelopment of floor area by building type. Furthermore, newer and larger buildings tend to use a lower \\nshare of fuel wood for space heating and water heating, giving way for electric heating and increasingly \\nheat pumps. A rebound effect depending on building type for higher usage of space heating due to the \\nimproved energy performance is expected. Equally , the prevalence of space cooling devices in \\nhouseholds is expected to increase strongly from 45% in 2012 in Zones A and B to 71% in Zone A and \\n74% in Zone B in 2040. In Zone C, the prevalence is expected to increase from 15% in 2012 to 37% in \\n2040. This l eads to an increase in energy consumption for space cooling that is not offset by the \\nimproved energy performance. The reconstruction rate of buildings therefore has the largest share in \\ndecreasing energy intensity and a changing fuel split in the resident ial sector. Wood usage in space \\nheating decreases from 33.2% in 2012 to 26.7% in 2040 when not accounting for any policies and \\nmeasures. In the same timeframe the use of electricity rises from 41.4% to 45.5%. The rest is covered \\nby LPG. \\nEnergy Intensity for space heating and space cooling is determined by heating degree days (HDD) and \\ncooling degree days (CDD). Values are taken for three climate zones. Zone A being the coastal region \\nwith the warmest climate, Zone B the central area including the capital Tirana with intermediate climate \\nand Zone C being the mountainous east of the country with the coolest climate. \\n \\nDegree Days Zone A Zone B Zone C \\nHDD (17.5°C) 1330 1534 2600 \\nCDD (18.5°C) 870 760 350 \\nTable 13: Heating and Cooling degree days (HDD base temperature: 17.5°C, CDD base temperature 18.5°C) \\nSource: SLED 2015 \\n '),\n",

In 2040, the sector reaches a value \\nadded of 2.6 times that of the 2012 -base value (in constant Euros).

The value-added split between subsectors is projected to remain constant. \\nThe most important sector in terms of energy demand is the Minerals sector, which is dominated by \\ncement production. There is also some production of ferro -chromium in the country and limited \\nproduction of recycled aluminium and lead. Processing of food, drink and tobacco plays only a minor \\nrole in terms of energy consumption. The demand for energy increases in all sectors with production \\nvolumes, which grow according to GDP growth projections. This is in part compensated by an efficiency \\ngain of 0.1% p.a. \\nTransport \\nThe main driver of the transport sector is the demand for mobility, seen in a rising annual demand for \\nperson km, as given in Figure 24. This variable has seen a strong growth in the past and is projected to \\ncontinue to grow with historic growth rate. Transport of freight is projected to undergo growth with \\nGDP.  \\nIn addition to tota l demand for transport, the share between transport modes is an important factor to \\nconsider, see Figure 25 for numbers on passenger transport. The larg est share of passenger transport \\nhappens by passenger cars, with motorcycles and navigation taking small shares. Shared and public \\ntransport is an important factor. Rail transport is negligible, so transport by busses is the only shared \\nroad transport mode. This has seen a decrease from 15.4% in 2015 to just below 11% in 2018. This share \\nis projected to recover to 13.7% by 2030 and remain stable after. This still corresponds to an increase in \\ntotal bus km even after 2030 due to the overall increase in transport. Another important factor to regulate \\nenergy demand in passenger transport is the load of vehicles, but this is not projected to change with \\nexisting measures. Freight transport is delivered by trucks and to a small share by rail and through \\nnavigation. Freight transport is projected to increase with GDP. The shares between these modes do not \\nsee a change until 2040.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 24: Annual demand for passenger transport in Albania, giving historic values and the future growth \\n'),\n",

As has been discussed above, passenger transport and notably by car is the main driver \\nof energy demand. Figure 26 shows how novel technologies are projected to penetrate the vehicle stock \\nof passenger cars in Albania.

Energy demand in the agricultural sector is driven by the pr oduction \\nvolume, which has been increasing over the past years and is seen to continue to increase (39% increase \\nin 2030, 83% increase in 2040, relative to 2018). Fisheries production is driven by GDP growth (40% \\nincrease in 2030, 95% increase in 2040, relative to 2018). The efficiency gain is projected at 0.1% p.a. \\nfor fisheries and agriculture. \\nNon-energy use of energy carriers is associated with production in the chemical sector (growing with \\nGDP, less than 1% of non-energy demand) and with the total demand for transport. \\nEnergy transformation \\nThe energy transformation sector includes oil extraction, refinery, electricity production and \\ntransmission and distribution. \\nAlbania had proven oil reserves of about 220 Million Barrels in 2018. It is extracted in one main site \\nand refined by two aged refineries. Due to the limited refining capacity, a large part of the crude oil is \\nexported and oil products are imported. \\nElectricity production is almost exclusively based on hydropower and is therefore renewable. As pects \\nof energy security play an increasing role with changing climate conditions and diminishing rainfall. \\nDry years with low hydroelectric output can currently not be compensated by other production \\ntechnologies. Possible solutions are an increased elect ricity interconnection with neighbouring \\ncountries, combined with the expansion of other renewable sources like solar power or wind energy that \\nare subject to different temporal variations than hydropower. Solar PV sees an increase in power \\ngeneration with  existing measures. Further, considerations are made to refurbish the Vlora thermal \\npower plant to be fuelled with natural gas. The Transadriatic Pipeline (TAP) recently entered into \\noperation in late 2020 and brings gas from Azerbaijan. Gas has a very fle xible character in energy \\ngeneration but will increase the GHG emissions of the electricity production sector. Relying on imported \\ngas does not necessarily improve the situation of energy security. '),\n",

These losses are projected to be reduced by existing measures \\nin the coming years.  \\nIndustrial processes and product use \\nThe largest share of IPPU emissions (10.9% of tot al emissions in 2018 in terms of CO2eq) stem from \\ncement production (85.6% of IPPU emissions) and these will continue to rise as cement production \\ncontinues to grow. This growth is projected to continue with GDP growth, which is broadly in line with \\nthe reconstruction in the residential sector and the demand in other sectors. The production of ferro -\\nchromium (growing with GDP) also leads to a small share of emissions (4.7% of IPPU emissions), as \\ndo the production of steel (1.8%) and lime (1.1%). The emissio n trends of refrigerating agents used in \\nplace of ozone depleting substances are projected to continue to rise until the year 2024 with historic \\ntrends (HFC 134a reaching 60 tonnes p.a., HFC 227ea reaching 15 tonnes p.a. as the by far dominant \\nsubstances). After 2024, emissions of these substances see no further increase in line with the Kigali \\namendment of the Montreal protocol.  \\nAgriculture \\nThe development of non -energy emissions in the agricultural sector (28.4% of total emissions) is \\ndetermined by the livestock population and agricultural practices. The population of all livestock species \\nhas been relatively constant over the past years, except for poultry and pigs. The number of the respective \\nspecies is therefore seen to continue in this increasing tre nd.  Manure management practices are not \\nprojected to change.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 27: Livestock historically and until the year 2050 \\n \\nIn addition to livestock, agricultural emissions stem from field management practices. The share of \\norganic farming is projected to increase to 10% in 2030, from 1% in 2018, but a further increase is not \\nprojected to happen after 2030. The practice of residue burning is projected to stop by 2025. The \\napplication of urea will be cut in half by 2030, with no further decline afterwards. \\n'),\n",

This is not projected to change with \\nexisting measures. Forest fires are another source of emissions, which can become a dominant factor in \\nthe overall GHG balance. Improved forest management can also help to reduce the impact and spread \\nof forest fires, however, an increase to median fire area (4.8kha) is still projected (increase of 50% until \\n2050), with no large fire episodes considered.  \\nWaste \\nEmissions from the waste sector (10.8% of total emissions, considering solid waste and waste water \\ntreatment) are projected to continue to increase.  \\nThe emissions of solid waste management are driven by the overall generation of waste per capita, which \\nis projected to increase from 584 kg/cap in 2018 with an annual growth rate of 1.5% to close to 700 \\nkg/cap in 2030 and 811 kg/cap in 2040.

By determined policies already adopted by way of the Integrated Waste Management \\nStrategy, this practice is overturned until th e year 2030. Full management of solid waste disposal is \\nachieved by 2030. In addition, the share of waste going to landfills is reduced to 45% in 2030 and 24% \\nin 2035 (from 81% in 2018), with an increasing share of recycling (increased from 14% in 2018 to 38% \\nin 2030 and 46% in 2035) and an increase in combustion in waste incineration plants with energy \\nrecovery (2.2% in 2018, 4.4% in 2025, 17% in 2030 and 30% in 2035).

Of note: While the other industrial sectors play only a minor role, it is \\nnecessary to regulate emissions of refrigerants used in place of ozone depleting substances, the second \\nlargest source of emissions in the IPPU sector. Main share of agriculture emissions (Figure 39) is taken \\nby enteric fermentation, which is not projected to change as livestock numbers stay close to constant. A \\nsmall reduction in the sector is achieved by a reduction of urea application. LULUCF emissions (Figure \\n40) are projected to remain net positive. The natural sink capacity of the forest cannot outweigh the \\nemissions due to forest management. Large episodes of forest fires are not considered in the model, but \\nthe median area affected by forest fires is projected to increase. Waste sector emissions (Figure 41) see \\na decline due to a change in management practices of solid waste disposal, changing recycling shares \\nand disposal site management. This does not lead to a complete drop in emissions, as existing waste \\ndisposal sites continue to emit. Emission reductions are also achieved by a change in wastewater \\nmanagement practices, essentially moving away from direct river discharge to well managed sites \\nwithout methane emissions.  \\n'),\n",

The difference is dete rmined by transmission losses and the refining of \\ncrude oil to refinery products. Currently, a large share of crude oil is exported and not processed in local \\nrefineries.

Current potential for the application of high -efficiency cogeneration and effici ent district \\nheating and cooling \\nThe power supply of Albania is currently based exclusively on hydropower, with solar power plants \\nprojected with existing measures until the year 2040. There is no fossil-fuelled power plant in operation \\nand no electricity generation from biomass. Cogeneration of heat and electricity is therefore not a \\npossible option. There are currently no district heating networks in operation or planned. The potential \\nfor such networks would exist in larger agglomerations. There is limited industry, which could provide \\na source for district heating (cement, iron and steel, ferro-alloy production). There is a general potential \\nfor district heating, as the use of fuel wood for heating is high in older buildings, which are undergoing \\na strong reconstruction scheme. Corresponding projects are currently not planned or projected to be \\nrealized.  \\n \\n'),\n",

Current energy mix, domestic energy resources, import dependency including relevant risks \\nThe current electricity mix of Albania consists almost exclusively of hydropower. At a currently still \\nvery low but rising level, solar power is entering the mix. Fossil energy sources, however, are entirely \\nabsent from the Albanian electricity generation sector. Although a project for an oil powered thermal \\npower plant in Vlora with 97 MW capacity was comple ted in 2011, it never entered into operation. A \\nrevitalisation of the plant after refurbishment for natural gas usage is planned as part of a policy of the \\nscenario with existing measures. \\nCritical for energy security is the absence of an electricity production reserve using another technology \\nto hedge for dry years with little hydroelectric output. In the past, this has led to frequent spikes in \\nelectricity imports, last observed in 2017 when the net import share in gross energy consumption rose \\nto 39% with net exports of 1% in both 2016 and 2018. \\nFigure 64 shows the total gross inland consumption, remaining rather constant with a slightly increase. \\nGeneration, net imports and the import share (left y-axis) are also shown.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 64: Electricity import share (historical data 2004 - 2018) \\n \\nApart from the electricity sector, the supply of fossil fuels and fossil fuel products pla ys a crucial role \\nin Albanian energy security. Despite being a crude oil producer, the country is strongly reliant on import \\nof refined oil products due to low and aging refinery capacities. Figure 65 clearly shows how crude oil \\nproduction is significantly higher than the production of refined oil products.  \\nFigure 66 shows net imports of fuel products. Negative values mean that exports exceed imports while \\npositive values mean that imports exceed exports. As can be seen, crude oil is largely exported while  \\nrefined oil products are mainly imported. This corresponds to a strong import dependency. \\n'),\n",

Projections of interconnector expansion requirements (including for the year 2030) \\nThe only neighbouring country currently not connected to the Albanian transmission network via \\ninterconnectors is North Macedonia (apart from Italy). In February 2020, an agreement has been signed \\nfor the construction of a 400 KV transmission line with a maximum active power of 1195 MW from \\nFier through Elbasan to Bitola in North Macedonia. The connection will support the potential to build a \\nregional energy market in South East Europe and create trading opportunities with countries between \\nBulgaria and Italy. \\n \\n4.5.2 Energy transmission infrastructure \\n \\ni. Key characteristics of the existing transmission infrastructure for electricity and gas \\nTo date, Albania does not have a natural gas transmission infrastructure. However, the Transadriatic \\nPipeline (TAP) has started operation in late 2020 and connects Italy, Albania and Greec e to the Trans-\\nAnatolian Pipeline in Turkey and the South Caucasus Pipeline in Azerbaijan and Georgia. This way, the \\npipeline can deliver up to 10 billion cubic metres of natural gas from Azerbaijani gas fields to Italy, \\nAlbania, Greece and (through an add itional interconnection point) to Bulgaria. Due to no existing \\ninfrastructure, by the time of writing (April 2021), natural gas from the pipeline has not been used in \\nAlbania. The following analysis is therefore confined to the electricity transmission inf rastructure. \\nInformation stems mainly from the Albanian Transmission Network Development Plan by the \\ntransmission network operator OST (OST 2018). \\n \\nThe Power Transmission System of Albania operates fifteen Substations (400 kV, 220 kV, and 150 kV) \\nas well as  \\n445.7 km of 400 kV lines,  \\n1250 km of 220 kV lines, 3 \\n4.4 km of 150 kV line and \\n1606.7 km of 110 kV lines.  \\nThe main hydroelectric power plants of “Drin River Cascade” (Fierza, Koman and Vau Dej ës) in the \\nNorthern part of Albania are connected in the 220 kV t ransmission network, which is also the main \\nconnection to the biggest load in the area of Tirana, Elbasan, Durr ës and Fier. The 110 kV network \\ncovers all urban areas of the country in order to supply the Distribution System that nowadays is operated \\nby OSHEE and is 100% state owned. (OST 2018) \\n \\nMore than 70% of the total generated installed capacity is connected in the 220 kV network. \\nAutotransformers 220/400 kV have a capacity of 1200 MVA and the 110 kV grid is connected with the \\n400 kV Rings by two 150 MVA Auto transformers installed in the south-eastern part of the network in \\nZemblak Substation. \\n \\nTransmission of electricity from the main sources of generation to the major centres of consumption is \\ndone through the 220 kV grid and further through the 220/110 kV transformation (2390 MVA). The 110 \\nkV network that supply all the 110 kV substations previously represented the main load nodes while \\nactually are connected around 20% of the installed generation capacity (OST 2018). \\n \\nFigure 73 shows the principal structure of the transmission network in Albania.

Projections of network expansion requirements at least until 2040 (including for the year 2030) \\nDuring recent years important projects have been realized that have significantly reduced the share of \\nnon-served electricity and the transmission losses. From 2005 to 2017, elect ricity losses in the \\ntransmission networks have fallen from 4.56% to 2.08%. This number does not include distribution grid \\nlosses (OST 2018). \\nAccording to model calculations from the scenario with existing measures, the annual increase in energy \\ndemand amounts to one to two percent between 2019 and 2040. In sum, electricity demand increases \\nfrom 512 ktoe in 2019 to 533 ktoe in 2030 and 621 ktoe in 2040.  At the same time, production capacities \\nincrease from 2343 MW in 2019 to 2965 MW in 2030 and 3228 MW. \\nTransmission networks have to follow the rising load and expansion and further increases in efficiency \\nare necessary.

This policy is in compliance with the \\nnational target of reaching 38% of gross final energy consumption from RES by 2020.  \\nLaw 7/2017 “On promoting the use of energy from renewable sources (RES)” provides for the \\nestablishment of two types of financial support for RES-E:  \\n\\uf0b7 The \"Feed-in-Tariff\", this is the legal financial support scheme for the purchase price of the \\nenergy produced by RES with limited generating capacity up to 2 MW for PV plants and up to \\n3 MW for wind farms. These projects are approved by the Minister according to the procedures \\nof DCM 822/2015, as amended “On the approval of the rules and procedures for construction \\nof the new electricity production capacities, which are not object of concession”. The \\nmethodology approved by DCM 369, dated 26.4.2017 “On the approval of the methodology for \\nthe determining the price of the purchase of the electricity produced from small renewable \\nsources from the sun and wind”, provides the approval from ERE of the fixed price that the \\nproducer will sell to OSHEE for 15 years. \\n\\uf0b7 Setting the \"Feed-in-Premium\" (FiP tariff) - this is the legal financial support scheme for the \\npurchase price of the energy produced from RES sources with installed generating capacity over \\n2 MW for PV plants and over 3 MW for wind farms. \\nThe methodology of support schemes, according to the capacity of the RES plant, is approved by DCM \\n369/2017 based on the law no. 7/2017 “For the promotion of the using of the energy from the renewable \\nsources (RES)”.  \\n\\uf0b7 For PV plants of a capacity of up to 2MW there are applied the support schemes with adjusted \\nfeed-in tariff tariff (FiT). For the year 2017 the price has been 100 € / MWh. For the year 2018 \\nand on this price has been revised at 71.2 Euro/Mwh.  \\n\\uf0b7 For the installed capacities of above 2MW the auction support scheme is applied based on CfD \\n(Contracts for Difference) which proved to be attractive for the interested investors. This scheme \\nhas proved to be successful and the experience gained shall serve as a base to orient the pricing \\npolicies of such technologies in the future.  \\n\\uf0b7 For the wind energy plants of a capacity up to 3MW the support schemes are based on an \\nadjusted feed-in-tariff (FiT). For 2017 the price has been set at 76 €/MWh and there is no other \\ndecision from the ERE for 2018 -2020. For the installed capacities over 3MW the auction \\nsupport scheme must be applied which and being provided through a CfD. An auction for wind \\ncapacity has been launched in the second quarter of 2021. \\nFor small hydropower pla nts up to 15 MW, the regulator is setting a FiT price each year promote the \\nRES energy production capacities /works, as a direct commitment to subsidize clean energy, versus \\nimports which are considered as energy of fossil origin as a mechanism to reach the target of 38% of net \\ncontribution of RES to the final consumption by end of 2020. \\nAccording to the INSTAT data for the year 2019 the electricity being produced from PV plants \\nrepresents approximately 0.43% of the total domestic production or 0.29% of the  total electricity \\nconsumption for this year. In 2019 there is no contribution from the wind farms despite a considerable \\nnumber of permissions being approved (the 2019 is the first year the other sources of renewables are \\ncontributing to the net domestic production of electricity). \\nSubsidies /support schemes in the agriculture sector \\nIn Albania, the subsidies applied for fossil fuels are limited. For the year 2021, a subsidy scheme is \\ngoing to be applied in the agriculture sector for certain categories of agriculture products. The decision \\nalso determines the norms of oil consumption per hectare for all these groups and subgroups that oil will \\nbe provided free of charge, which according to the Council of Minister decision consists in:  \\n\\uf0b7 exemption from the excise tax (37 ALL /lt) (/eq. 0.299 euro) '),\n",

Where appro priate, figures show absolute values, scenario comparisons and breakdowns of \\nsubcategories for the differences between the WEM scenario (With Existing Measures) presented in \\nChapter 4 and the WAM scenario (With Additional Measures, denoted 'WAM RE full cap acity' in the \\nfollowing plots) presented in this chapter. \\nThe WAM scenario considers that renewable energy plants run full capacity independently from \\nelectricity demand in the country. This builds on a liquid market and a high interconnection level. As \\nrenewable electricity comes with no or limited running costs, there is always a buyer for electricity. To \\nanalyse the effect of this assumption, this document in some cases also shows the results for an \\nalternative scenario in which renewable power generator s run to meet domestic demand only. This \\nscenario is then called 'WAM RE to meet demand'. Note that in most cases, this setup has no influence \\non results as the surplus electricity is simply exported. The renewable power plants do not lead to \\nemissions and do not influence the energy demand. Main influence of this setup is on the renewable \\nenergy share, both in primary and final energy. \\n \\ni.

Table 35 shows an overview of values for WEM and WAM. In comparison with the \\nbase year 2018, WAM entails a reduction of emissions of 6.1% in 2030, with an increase of emissions \\nseen in the years after 2030, reaching values just above 2018 in 2040 (plus 4.0%). The WEM scenario \\nsees an increase of emissions by 15.4% in 2030 and an increase by 30.5% in 2040.

The following figures show historic data in \\nRES share for 2016-2018 and projections with additional measures. For the share in transport (RES-T), \\nthis includes the multipliers for the use of electricity in road and rail transport, which explains the strong \\nincrease. No advanced biofuels (with increased multiplier s) are considered. The share of renewable \\nenergy in heating and cooling (RES-HC) falls as the share of wood for heating decreases.  The share of \\nrenewable electricity (RES-E) is largely determined by hydropower, with increases projected for solar \\nPV.

Assessment of policy interactions (between existing policies and measures and planned policies \\nand measures within a policy dimension and between existing policies and measures and \\nplanned policies and measures of different dimensions) at least until the last year of the period \\ncovered by the plan, in particular to establish a robust understanding of the impact of energy \\nefficiency/ energy savings policies on the sizing of the energy system and to reduce the risk of \\nstranded investment in energy supply \\n \\nThe modelling results presented in th is chapter and for existing measures in Chapter 4 describe the \\nenergy system in aggregated form, considering the policies outlined in Chapter 3.  \\nEach individual policy has an individual effect if implemented to the existing system. However, the \\ninteractions of policies need to be considered as this can increase or decrease their effect on the final \\nsaving values. An example is building policies that, among others, target the replacement of wood fired \\nstoves for space heating in favour of electricity powered heating and heat pumps. The fuel switch itself \\nwill lead to a decrease in energy consumption (especially in the case of heat pumps) but the stronger \\neffect in terms of GHG emissions savings occurs in combination with the enlargement of renewable \\nelectricity generation. All measures that lead to an increase in electricity consumption in favour of \\nanother fuel require an adjustment of electricity production capacity or cross -border interconnectors.  \\nSimilarly, energy efficiency improvements have to be part of planning for electricity supply.  \\n \\nWithout energy efficiency measures, a stronger capacity increase for electricity generation is necessary \\nto avoid import dependency. Energy efficiency measures can reduce the pressure on both the production \\nand transmission capacity. By accounting for supply, network and demand sides of the energy systems, \\nboth GHG emissions and costs for overinvestments in production capacities can be avoided. \\n \\nFigure 125 shows the GHG emission savings for policies and measures implemented in the WAM \\nscenario. Note that some of the PaMs have not been implemented in the modelling as they do not act \\ndirectly on the system but are nonetheless important to follow. Some of the PaMs have been \\nimplemented in combination, then a separate analysis is not possible. Other PaMs (on renewable \\ncapacity) have been split. The effects of G-LF1 and G-LF2 are not included in the figure for readability \\nbut given in Figure 127. The total effect of all policies is shown in Figure 126. As becomes evident, the \\njoint effect of the policies in WAM (savings of 2347 ktCO2eq in 2030) is larger than the sum of the \\nseparate effects (2321 ktCO2eq in 2030), with this effect increasing over time. This difference is due to \\nthe interactions of the different policies,  particularly of energy efficiency and renewable energy PaMs \\ndescribed above.  \\n \\nRenewable energy plants only lead to emission savings when replacing thermal power plants, as is the \\ncase only after 2030 outside of dry years. In other years, they may be replacing imported electricity, the \\nemissions of which are accounted for in the country of electricity generation. On the other hand, the \\nthermal power plant of Korça only leads to emissions in dry years, which are not shown in the figure. \\nEnergy efficiency PaMs have only a small effect as as long as they only reduce the demand for electricity \\nin the system, since there is ample of supply of renewable electricity in any case. Nevertheless, and as \\ndescribed above, the energy efficiency first principle should be followed. There are only few PaMs \\nacting on non -energy emissions in the WAM scenario. In terms of total emission savings, the forest \\nmanagement has by far the largest effect.  \\n '),\n",

The environmental effects of energy and climate policies aiming \\nto increase the share of renewable energies (RE) in the energy system, as well as improve ene rgy \\nefficiency (EE) across different consumption sectors, are mostly evident and well researched. To a large \\nextent, the implementation of measures related to EE and to increase the share of RE is driven by the \\naim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate climate change and comply with the goals of the Paris \\nAgreement. However, both EE and RE measures can have a range of impacts towards households, \\nemployment, private companies, and the public sector. These impacts might be substantial, and can be \\ndocumented in different dimensions, e.g. ranging from macro -economic effects (impacts on \\nemployment, public budgets, value creation, etc.), health impacts (due to reduced local air and water \\npollution) social impacts (alleviation of energy or fuel poverty, impr oved comfort and well -being, \\nreduction of inequality), among many others (for an overview, see Bouzarovski (2014)). A \\ncomprehensive estimation of the multip le effects of energy and climate policies across actors and \\ndimensions is beyond the scope of this study. This section provides a brief overview on non -energy \\nimpacts across three key dimensions, namely: 1) disposable household incomes, as a key indicator to \\nmeasure the impacts on fuel and energy poverty 2) public budgets, to understand if measures have the \\npotential to increase or decrease public revenue streams and 3) employment, as energy and climate \\npolicies bear great potential to provide green jobs. \\n \\nDisposable household incomes \\nAchieving a substantial decarbonization of the energy sector will require major efforts in the building \\nsectors. At EU level, greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector represent more than a third of total \\nemissions. Residential buildings account for 75 % of the European building stock, from which more \\nthan 40 % was built before 1960 and more than 90 % before 1990. Low income households represent \\nabout 17 % of households in the EU (Eurostat, 2014), while estimates of EU-inhabitants suffering from \\nfuel poverty ranging between 50-160 million inhabitants, corresponding to roughly 6–21 % of the total \\nEU-population (Bouzarovski (2014); BPIE (2015); Bird et al. (2010)).  Energy efficiency policies in the \\nresidential sector bear great pote ntial to improve the disposable income of households. Disposable \\nhousehold incomes can be increased by improved EE in space heating, hot water generation or energy-\\nusing products like fridges or televisions, given that the overwhelming share of all impleme nted \\nmeasures are cost -effective (Yushchenko and Patel 2017; Dodoo et al. 2017) . Derived from this, EE \\nbears a great potential for the alleviation of energy poverty, but additionally induce the multiple benefits \\nof EE, such as improving human health, lowerin g energy subsidies through social policies, increased \\nthe value of properties, local spending and employment, reduced emissions, etc. Initial investments in \\nEE for renovation of buildings usually pay off in terms of heating cost reduction, which enables \\nconsumers to spend their money elsewhere in the long run. However, as the evaluation of the German \\nKfW Energy-efficient Refurbishment Programme emphasizes, it must be noted that these investments \\nare profitable after a period of several decades ( KfW Group (2018)). Disregarding investment costs is \\nhence a simplification and likewise the neglect of rebound and spill-over effects. '),\n",

For example, changes in public \\nbudgets can be triggered by new jobs generated (e.g. by EE measures the building sector). On the other \\nhand, policies comprising tax cuts and subsidies towards targeted activities to improve EE and deploy a \\nhigher share of RE can go along with higher public spending or reduced tax incomes. As an indicator \\nfor the impact on public budgets, additional income tax revenues) for a typical average job in the related \\nsectors/subsectors can be computed, using country specific income tax rates. Losses of income tax in \\nthe energy sector can also be considered in this way here. The approach can be extended to other impacts \\nrelated to the public budget, such as VAT and energy taxes to calculate positive or negative effects on \\npublic budgets.  \\n \\nEmployment effects \\nEmployment effects can be of great importance, as providing employment opportunities and reducing \\nunemployment rates represent key political objective s. Direct effects of EE on employment are based \\non two main drivers: investments in EE measures and related energy savings. While the former triggers \\ndemand impulses in industries producing relevant technologies, the latter reduces demand related to \\nenergy supply in the long run. In both cases, these impacts indirectly affect other sectors, e.g. energy \\nproducers and distributors. As various studies have shown, net employment gains are likely to occur \\nwhen shifting from spending on energy consumption to investing in EE measures (Wei et al. 2010; Scott \\net al. 2008; Bacon and Kojima 2011). Provided that EE measures are cost -effective they also increase \\ndisposable incomes, which further stimulates job creation in the long -run. Measures improving energy \\nefficiency by construction -intensive activities, such as buildi ngs envelope refurbishment, have also \\nshown to have great potential for employment creation. \\n \\nTable 49 presents a qualitative assessment of non -energy impacts of selected PaMs, addressing the \\ndimensions disposable household incomes, public budgets and employment18[1]. The values indicated \\nin the table are “low”, “middle”, “high” (i.e. low meaning a PaM only has a minor positive effect on the \\nrespective non -energy impact) if a PaM has the potential for respective effects on the examined \\ndimensions, and “neutral”, if it has no effect. Some PaMs require either public funds to operate, or \\ncomprise tax exemptions to incentive certain activities, thus impacting public budgets in a negative way. \\nThese effects are indicated by a value of “negative” in the respective impact towards public budgets. In \\ngeneral terms, policies improving EE in the residential sector, both in the building stock, as well as of \\nappliances and devices, bear pote ntial to improve household´s disposable incomes and reduce energy \\npoverty. Regarding employment, policies requiring construction works, such as building's \\nrefurbishments or infrastructure related projects, bear potential to create green jobs.  With regard to \\npublic budgets, policies triggering high employment might also improve income -tax revenue, thus \\nimproving public budget. Likewise, policies improving EE of public energy use, such as improved EE \\nin public buildings, can reduce public expenditures for energy and benefit public budgets.  \\n  \\n                                                      \\n18 Of note, several not-included PaMs are of cross-cutting nature or are supportive or enabling to considered \\nPaMs to achieve its non-energy impacts. A prominent example might be Feed-in tariffs, which as such do not \\nlead to employment effects, but the induced development of power plants does. \"),\n",

Most of the job creation is taking place in the branches construction and manufacturing while \\nhaving slightly negative effects in the sectors mining and quarrying and branches directly related to the \\nsupply of energy. PaM EE-L1 and EE-L2 can be expected to have substantial impact on the employment \\nderived from the energy savings they generate and the additional investments related to these. The \\ncombined effect can be estimated to create 3,500 to 12,000 full-time equivalents19 in the period 2019 to \\n2030. As the share of public buildings in the total building stock is relatively small the main share of \\nthese additional employment effects will be generated by the implementation of energy performance \\nstandards for buildings and its effect on the renovation activity improving residential buildings. \\n \\nEmployment effects - Renewable energy \\nThe development of renewable energy power plants bears great potential for the creation of employment. \\nWhile the renewable plants would not be manufactured in Albania, there is also a notable effect that can \\nbe attributed to the construction phase of RE power plants, while its operation is not employment \\nintensive. Most of the employment is therefore expected to be created during the construction phase of \\nthe power plants. Figure 127 shows an estimate of expected employment creation during the \\nconstruction and operation and maintained phases of solar PV and wind pow er plants. It is based on \\nnormalized employment factors, whereas normalization is carried out from the commonly used unit \\nperson-years/MW into the unit jobs/MW by assuming a 20-year lifetime of projects. Results are based \\non employment factors reported by Cameron and van der Zwaan (2015) in the high bound estimate, who \\nanalyses the body of available peer-reviewed scientific literature with this regard. In particular, solar PV \\nbears potential for green jobs creation.  \\n \\nIn the WEM scenario, around 280 MW of solar PV are added to the power system until 2030. This \\nresults in around 460 jobs in the installation phase, and 460 further jobs in the operation and maintenance \\nphase, resulting in a total of 900 solar PV related jobs until 2030. By a similar metric, a total of 150 jobs \\nare created due to wind power plants, with a higher share (two thirds) attributed to the operation and \\nmaintenance phase. \\n \\nThe WAM scenario comprises a capacity addition of 770 MW until 2030 for solar PV and 450 MW in \\nthe same timeframe for wind. This results in around 1300 jobs in each the installation and operation and \\nmaintenance phase for solar PV, or a total of 2600 jobs. As for wind, a total of 460 jobs are created in \\nthe WAM scenario. \\n                                                      \\n19 Gross effect not taking to account second order effects and limitations such as labour force shortages.

Other important Ministries are: Ministry of Finance and Economy \\n(“MoFE”); Ministry for Health and Social Welfare; Ministry of Tourism and Environment (\"MoTE\"). \\n \\nRegulatory bodies and other government agencies for energy: \\nEnergy Regulatory Authority (ERE): The Energy Regulatory Authori ty (“ERE”) is an independent \\npublic body responsible for the regulation of activities in the electricity and natural gas sectors. ERE is \\nalso responsible for the development of most secondary legislation in the sector as well as approving \\nthe electricity market rules. ERE is the competent body for: \\n\\uf0b7 issuing licenses for carrying out electricity generation, transmission, distribution, supply and \\ntrade of electricity \\n\\uf0b7 for approving the grid codes which govern the connection with and access to the transmission \\nand distribution networks to all power producers.  \\n\\uf0b7 approving tariffs in the sector, including feed-in tariffs for RES producers, tariffs for access to \\nthe transmission and distribution networks, and tariffs for end users supplied by the Universal \\nService Provider.   \\n\\uf0b7 Approving the standard industry documents such as the standard PPA, which will be used by \\npriority RES producers.  \\nAgency of Energy Efficiency: is established by a Decision of the Council of Ministers in accordance \\nwith Law no. 124/2015 “On energy efficiency.  Duties and responsibilities of the Agency for EE are \\nset out in detail in Article 8 and 25 of the EE Law, and include: \\n\\uf0b7 Develop secondary legislation and programs to promote energy efficiency. \\n\\uf0b7 Develop and monitor the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (“NEEAP”) and prepare an \\nannual progress report regarding the NEEAP. \\n\\uf0b7 Work with market participants and stakeholders to develop a database to monitor progress being \\nmade in improving energy efficiency. \\n\\uf0b7 Develop technical standards and regulations to improve the energy efficiency of products. \\n\\uf0b7 Evaluate projects to improve energy efficiency for potential funding from the EE Fund. \\n\\uf0b7 Support energy efficiency t hrough providing advice, training, and developing open source \\ncontracts for energy services. \\n\\uf0b7 Verify the accuracy of data from energy audits, if deemed necessary. \\nEnergy Efficiency Fund:  The EE Law mandates the setting up of an Energy Efficiency Fund that shall \\nbe managed by a Board of Trustees composed by representatives of different public institutions. The \\nrevised EE law is under consultation and it will be decided if the Energy Efficiency Fund will be \\nestablished or if it is necessary to create other financial mechanisms for investments in the field of energy \\nefficiency. Currently, is pre estimated that there are no favourable conditions to establish the Energy \\nEfficiency Fund for Albania due to the bottlenecks that were faced since this process has initiated (2017). \\nThus, the related articles might be excluded from the law. \\nAKBN – National Agency of Natural Resources: The National Agency of Natural Resources \\n(“AKBN”) reports to MIE. AKBN mission is the development, supervision of rational use of natural \\nresources, according to the government policy, and monitoring of their post -exploitation in mining, \\npetroleum and energy.

The National Territorial  Planning \\nAgency is in charge of coordinating the land use planning and thus has an important role with regard to \\nmaking use of the renewable energy potential which is determined by the provisions in the land laws. \\nEnergy spatial planning (also called energy zoning or energy master planning) has a crucial role in \\nachieving NECP targets. The National Territo ry Planning Agency and its functions are based on Law \\n\"On Territory Planning and Development\" No. 28/2017.  \\nAZHT - National Agency of Development: AZHT has responsibility for making decisions regarding \\nspecific projects of national importance.  This includ es, for example, approval of construction permits \\nfor projects in the energy sector such as power generation, transmission and distribution, and oil and gas \\nprojects. \\nAKM – National Environment Agency: National Environment Agency (“AKM”) is an institution \\nsubordinated to the Ministry of Tourism and Environment, which is responsible for reviewing and \\napproving the environmental impact assessments for large development projects, such as those in the \\nenergy sector.  The Agency also has responsibilities for mon itoring compliance with environmental \\nstandards. \\n \\nPublic Energy Companies \\nIn addition to the government departments and agencies presented above, there are a number of large \\npublic energy companies in Albania who are essentially the incumbent state-owned utilities.    \\nAlbania Power Corporation, KESh: KESH remains the dominant electricity generator in Albania, \\ngenerating ~75% of power generated in 2015. Originally KESh was established as a state -owned, \\nvertically-integrated company comprising all functions o f electricity generation, transmission and \\ndistribution. KESH is also responsible for the administration, the proper operation and guaranteeing the \\ntechnical and operational safety of the power plants it operates.  \\nTransmission System Operator, OST: OST is the Transmission System Operator (“TSO”) in Albania \\nmanaging the network at 110 kV and above.  TSO is an independent joint stock company whose shares \\nare owned by the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The main responsibilities of TSO are:  \\n- Power flows management in the electricity transmission system; \\n- System balancing services; \\n- Development of the transmission network to guarantee the security of the electricity transmission \\nsystem; \\n- Covering of network losses and providing ancillary services; \\n- Cross – border capacity allocation; \\n- Connecting users with the transmission system network. \\nDistribution Company, OShEE: OShEE owns the electricity power distribution system below 110 kV.  \\nOSSHEE is the parent company in the capacity of the founding shareholder, establishing three controlled \\ncompanies, aiming to unbundle the distribution activity, the universal service of supply and sales for the \\nfree electricity market as follows: \\n- Universal Service Supplier S.A. (FSHU) for the “Electricity supply of end-customers operating in \\nthe regulated market defined by the legislation in force”.  \\n- Free Market Supplier S.A. (FTL) for the “Purchase and management of electricity and operation in \\nthe free market, etc”.  \\n- Distribution System Operator S.A. (OSSH) for the “Distribution of electricity, construction, \\noperation and maintenance of the electricity distribution network for the supply of electricity to \\ncustomers, connection of customers and users of the network electricity distribution, installation and \\nelectricity metering services, etc”.  \\nOSHEE S.A. through the Albanian Energy Regulator Authority, transferred its licenses to the newly \\ncreated companies.

ВОВЕД ВО СТРАТЕГИСКА ОЦЕНА НА ЖИВОТНА СРЕДИНА (СОЖС) \\nПостапката за СОЖС во Европската унија е воспоставена со Директивата \\n2001/42/EC на Европскиот парламент и на Советот од 27 јуни 2001 година за \\nоценување на ефектите од некои планови и програми врз животната средина која е \\nцелосно транспонирана во Законот за животната средина. \\n \\nСтратегиската оценка на животната средина ( СОЖС) претставува систематски \\nпроцес со кој се врши оценување на последици врз животната средина од \\nпредложениот плански документ (стратегија, план или програма). Со стратегиската \\nоцена на животната средина се земаат предвид одредени превентивни мерки, што \\nовозможуваат заштита на животната средина од сите можни аспекти, во процесот \\nна планирање или донесување на одлуки на ниво на „ стратегиски акции“ или \\nполитики, планови и програми. \\n \\nПостапката за СОЖС се спроведува на документи, планови и стратегии и е на \\nхиерархирско највисоко ниво бидејќи уште во фазата на планирање ги предвидува \\nвлијанијата од спроведувањето на тие документи и дава насоки за нивно навремено \\nминимизирање или елиминирање. Постапката инсистира на вклучување на целите \\nна заштита на животната средина во целите на планскиот/стратешки документ. \\n \\nСОЖС треба да обезбеди високо ниво на заштита на животната средина, \\nспроведување на насоките од релевантни стратешки и плански документи и \\nинтегрирање на целите на животната средина во подготовката и усвојувањето на \\nстратегии, планови и програми (плански документи), а во насока на промовирање на \\nодржливиот развој.  \\n \\nСОЖС претставува важен инструмент за помош за постигнување на одржлив развој \\nво јавното планирање и креирање на политики. Крајна цел, а воедно и придобивки \\nод СОЖС поспката е: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 O безбедување на високо ниво на заштита на животната средина; \\n\\uf0b7 Промовирање и интегрирање на принципите на одржлив развој во планскиот \\nдокумент,  \\n\\uf0b7 Подобрување на процесот на планирање преку интегрирање на аспектите на \\nживотната средина уште во фазата на подготовката и пред усвојувањето на \\nпланските документи. \\n \\n2.1 Цели на стратегиска оцена на животна средина \\n \\nЦелта на постапката за стратегиска оцена на животната средина е да осигура дека \\nинформациите за значајните влијанија врз животната средина од планскиот \\nдокумент се собрани и се достапни до донесувачите на одлуките, во текот на \\nподготовката на планскиот документ и пред неговото донесување.  \\n \\nПостапката се спроведува уште во фазата на планирање со цел сите \\nидентификувани влијанија, односно соодветните мерки за елиминирање или \\nконтрола на влијанијата да се предвидат во најраната фаза на подготовката на \\nдокументот. Заради тоа, СОЖС е клучна компонента во одржливиот развој, \\nфокусирана на заштитата на животната средина. \\n \\nСОЖС има за цел да обезбеди рамка за дејствување врз процесот на одлучување \\nуште во најрана фаза кога планските документи ( кои пак најчесто предвидуваат \\nиндвидуални проекти) се подготвуваат.

Паралелно со растот на глобалната побарувачка за прифатлива и сигурна \\nенергија, светот се префрла на енергија со ниска употреба на јаглерод. \\nОбновливите извори се камен-темелник на транзицијата на енергија. Напредокот во \\nтехнологијата е заснован на нови случувања кои се фокусираат на подобрувања на \\nенергетската ефикасност, технологии со ниско ниво на јаглерод и складирање на \\nенергија. Исто така, намалувањето на трошоците за обновлива технологија за \\nпроизводство на електрична енергија станува конкурентно со традиционалните \\nизвори на енергија. \\n  \\nЦели и трендови на Европската Унија \\n \\nЕвропската Унија ( ЕУ) има поставено амбициозна политика за климата преку  \\nусвоената Стратегија за енергетска унија, која се заснова на пет тесно поврзани \\nстолбови и димензии кои се зајакнуваат меѓусебно: \\n1. Безбедност, солидарност и доверба: диверзификација на европските извори \\nна енергија и обезбедување енергетска безбедност преку солидарност и \\nсоработка меѓу земјите-членки; \\n2. Целосно интегриран внатрешен енергетски пазар: овозможување слободен \\nпроток на енергија низ цела ЕУ преку соодветна инфраструктура и без никакви \\nтехнички или регулаторни бариери; \\n3. Енергетска ефикасност: подобрената енергетска ефикасност ќе ја намали \\nзависноста од увозот на енергија, ќе ги намали емисиите и ќе ги зголеми \\nработните места и растот; \\n4. Климатска акција - декарбонизација на економијата: активностите вклучуваат \\nполитики кои ќе бидат водач на обновливите извори на енергија (ОИЕ), систем \\nза тргување со емисии ( ЕТС), национални цели за сектори надвор од ЕТС, \\nпатоказ за мобилноста со ниски емисии; \\n5. Истражувања, иновации и конкурентност: поддршка на откритијата во \\nтехнологиите со ниско ниво на јаглерод и чиста енергија преку \\nприоретизирање на истражување и иновации кои би ја воделе транзицијата и \\nби ја подобриле конкурентноста.

Македонија се наоѓа на северната полутопка \\nи тоа малку појужно од средишниот напоредник, што значи дека лежи во умерениот \\nтоплински појас и е поблиску до екваторот отколку до северниот Пол. Близината на \\nЕгејското Море од само 60 km и на Јадранското Море од 80 km имаат големо \\nвлијание врз климата на Р. Македонија. Тоа особено е изразено по долината на \\nреките Вардар, Струмица, а нешто помалку и на Црни Дрим, каде навлегуваат топли \\nи влажни воздушни маси. Поради положбата, во Р. Македонија има четири јасно \\nизразени годишни времиња. Летото трае од 22 јуни до 23 септември, а зимата од 22 \\nдекември до 21 март.  \\n \\nТемпературата на воздухот се менува во зависност од годишните времиња, \\nрелјефот, близината на морињата, големината на природните и вештачки езера, \\nпошуменоста и слично. Средната годишна температура на воздухот во Р. \\nМакедонија изнесува 11,5°С и се движи од околу 0°С на високите планини до 15°С \\nво јужните подрачја околу Дојран и Валандово. Досега најниската измерена \\nтемпература на воздухот изнесува -32° С во Берово, а највисоката 45° С во Демир \\nКапија. Општо земено, пониските делови на котлините и речните долини се потопли \\nод планините, јужните страни се потопли од северните, а западните страни се \\nпотопли од источните.  \\n \\nВрнежите во Р. Македонија во просек годишно изнесуваат околу 680 mm, што е \\nрелативно мала вредност. Најмногу врнежи има во западниот дел на државата, \\nособено во долината на реката Радика ( околу 1200-1400 mm/ год.). Кон исток \\nврнежите се намалуваат, така што во централниот дел на Повардарието, во \\nТиквешијата и Овче Поле, тие изнесуваат под 500 mm годишно. Поради малата \\nоблачност и врнежливост, овде се јавува најдолго осончување со околу 2500- 2600 \\nчаса годишно. Кон исток врнежите повторно малку се зголемуваат. Во зимскиот дел \\nод годината, особено на планините, врнежите често се во вид на снег. \\n \\nВетровите во Р. Македонија се честа појава, особено во зимскиот период. Сепак, \\nтие не се толку силни како во другите делови на Европа и Светот. Врз појавата, \\nправецот и силата на ветровите најмногу влијае релјефот. Најпознати ветрови се \\nвардарецот и југот.

Овде мразот е ретка појава, температурите многу ретко паѓаат под \\n-10°С, но преку лето се случува да се искачат и над 40°С. Поради отвореноста кон \\nсевер и југ, ветровитоста е голема, особено кај Гевгелија.

Македонија е 26.000.000 \\nt/годишно, со очекуван пораст на количините од 1,7% годишно во следните 10-12 \\nгодини ( со базна година 2012). Пресметките на генериран отпад во општините се \\nбазираат на претпоставката дека количината за урбаните подрачја изнесува 350 \\nkg/година/жител, а за руралните подрачја 190 kg/година/жител.  \\n \\nДепонијата \"Дрисла\", која му служи на Скопскиот регион, е единствена депонија во \\nР.Македонија со која релативно добро се управува. На општинските депонии ( или \\nодлагалишта) во руралните подрачја, отпадот едноставно го отстрануваат \\nкомуналните претпријатија без оперативни трошоци, со исклучок на некои режиски \\nтрошоци ( плата на чувари, доколку има) и повремените трошоци за потрошувачка \\nна вода за гасење на спонтано настанати пожари. Ниту една од 54- те општински \\nдепонии не ги исполнува барањата за санитарно работење и заштита на животната \\nсредина.  \\n \\nСобирањето на комуналниот отпад го вршат, главно, јавни претпријатија. Само мал \\nдел од собирачите на отпад се приватни претпријатија, обично оние кои работат со \\nотпадот во руралните подрачја. Околу 70% од вкупното население ги користи \\nуслугите на собирање на отпад, но само 10% од тоа во руралните населби. \\nСобирањето, селекцијата и транспортот на отпадот е недоволно во неколку области \\nза да се постигне придржување кон постојните прописи. Голем дел од отпадот \\nистекува, а возилата за собирање отпад се многу стари, со мал капацитет и често се \\nрасипани. Од корисниците на услугите се собира мешан индустриски и комунален \\nотпад, вклучувајќи опасни фракции на отпадот. Дневните активности вообичаено се \\nкарактеризираат со ниско продуктивни практики и несоодветна искористеност на \\nпостојните ресурси што не поттикнува обезбедување на услуга што ќе биде \\nефикасна во споредба со трошоците.  \\n \\nСелекција и одделно собирање на фракции од комуналниот отпад е на ниско ниво и \\nсе врши во само дел од општините и за ограничен број на фракции. \\n \\nСо стапувањето во сила на Законот за управување со пакување и отпад од \\nпакување ( ЗУПОП), Законот за управување со батерии и акумулатори и отпадни \\nбатерии и акумулатори и Законот за управување со електрична и електронска \\nопрема, бизнис секторот презема активности за рециклирање на овие видови \\nматеријали, како што се метали, хартија, пластики, батерии и акумулатори и стара \\nелектрична и електронска опрема.  \\n \\nСистемот за управување со отпад од пакување е воспоставен од 2010 година, кога \\nстапи во сила ЗУПОП. Според годишните извештаи, поднесени до МЖСПП од \\nколективните постапувачи (во земјата има четири такви), вкупната количина собран \\nотпад од пакување е 50 662 тони, од кои се собираат и обработуваат 7947 тони.  \\n \\nНивото на рециклиран отпад од пакување, исто така, е ниско. Затоа има потреба од \\nпонатамошни интензивни активности од страна на државата, локалните надлежни \\nтела и бизнис секторот за подобрување во овој домен. Иста е ситуацијата и во \\nдоменот на отпадни батерии и акумулатори и отпад од електрична и електронска \\nопрема.  \\n \\n                                                 \\n9 Стратегија за управување со отпад на Р: Македонија 2008-2020 '),\n",

Се проценува дека \\nбројот на ѓубришта, особено во руралните општини, изнесува околу 1000.  \\n \\nАктивните комунални ѓубришта се категоризирани според проценката на нивниот \\nризик за животната средина. 16 депонии се рангирани со висок ризик, 16 со среден \\nризик и 19 со низок ризик за животната средина. 4 од депониите со висок ризик се \\nкласирани како посебни случаи со висок ризик и треба во краток период да се \\nзатворат или да се санираат.  \\n \\nКомуналните депонии и дивите депонии претставуваат ризик за загадување на \\nвоздухот, почвата, површинските води и подземните води, како и потенцијални \\nризици за биолошката разновидност, земјоделското земјиште и човековото здравје, \\nкако последица од депонирање на мешан опасен и неопасен отпад. Дополнителен \\nпроблем претставува традиционалното палење на комуналниот отпад, отпадот од \\nрастителни ткива, како и на пластика од плантажното или од силажното \\nпроизводство на отворен простор; таквиот начин на палење на отпадот може да \\nпредизвика синтетизирање на високо токсичните и био-акумулативните органски \\nсостојки, а неконтролираните емисии во воздухот предизвикуваат загадување на \\nамбиентниот воздух и долгорочно загадување на земјоделските почви и на \\nрастенијата.

Не постојат официјално лиценцирани собирачи и транспортери на опасен \\nотпад. Најголеми количества на опасен отпад се произведуваат во металургиските \\nиндустриски постројки и генерално се складираат на непрописни депонии во кругот \\nна фирмите. Тие претставуваат еколошки жаришта со нивното влијание врз \\nживотната средина. Дел од согорливите опасни отпадни масла се согоруваат како \\nгорива. Најголем дел од опасните отпадни масла, создадени во производниот \\nсектор и во други активности денес се горат како горива. \\n \\nДепонии од пепел и згура \\nАктивностите за согорување на фосилни горива во постоечките капацитети на \\nЕЛЕМ, РЕК Битола и РЕК Осломеј, резултираат со создавање на отпад од лебдечка \\nпепел и згура. Овој отпад се одлага на површини во близина на местото на \\nсоздавање (енергетските постројки).  \\n \\nДепонијата за пепел и згура на РЕК Битола зафаќа приближна површина околу \\nседум километри квадрани.

Како резултат \\nна повеќедецениска работа на најголемите постројки за согорување (РЕК Битола и \\nРЕК Осломеј), создадени и одложени се значителни количини пепел и шљака од \\nсогорување.

Намалувањето на емисиите е резултат на: \\n\\uf02d Намалувањето на употребата на јагленот во производството на електрична енергија (намалувањето на емисиите на \\nCO2 се постигнува во две од трите сценарија на Стратегијата).  \\n\\uf02d Интензивното воведување на ОИЕ за производство на електрична енергија (главно фотоволтаична, ветерна и хидро). \\n\\uf02d Во зелено сценарио, нивото на емисии на стакленички гасови би можело да се преполови во споредба со BAU26 во \\n2030 година и намалено за две третини во 2040 година.  \\n\\uf02d Во споредба со нивоата во 2014 година, сите сценарија покажуваат намалување на нивото на емисии на стакленички \\nгасови во 2030 година, додека за 2040 година, кај референтното сценарио нивото на емисии на стакленички гасови ќе \\nбиде слично како во 2014 година. \\n\\uf02d Намалувањето на стакленичките гасови ќе биде значително остварено со влегување на земјата во ЕТС (Систем за \\nтргување со емисии) како резултат на намалувањето на употребата на јагленот во производството на електрична \\nенергија ( поради повисоката цена на CO 2 новите домашни рудници за лигнит нема да бидат одржлива опција во \\nумереното и зеленото сценарио, со влезот на земјата во ЕТС системот). \\n При понатамошно користење на постоечките рудници на јаглен и во случај на отворање на нови рудници, влијанијата врз \\nклиматските промени од постројките за производство на електрична енергија од \\nфосилни горива ќе бидат негативни, глобални \\nи долгорочни (додека работат постројките).

Површински и подземни води\\nВлијанија врз површинските води главно се однесува на искористувањето на хидро потенцијалот за производство на \\nелектрична енергија (големи и мали хидроелектрани) кое во голема мера ќе зависи од степенот на применетост на мерките \\nза спречување и намалување на негативните влијанија кои генерално се јавуваат кај овој тип на ОИЕ. Во секој случај, \\nвлијанијата врз површинските и подземните води можат да бидат негативни, локални и регионални и долгорочни ( во \\nпериодот на работа на овие централи). \\nВлијанија врз површинските и подземните води се јавуваат и кај рудниците за јаглен (постоечки и евентуално отворање на \\nнови). Овие влијанија се директни, локални и долготрајни заради пренасочување на природниот водотек на површинските \\nводи во рамките на рудниците. Влијанијата врз подземните води се јавуваат при напредување на копот по вертикала. \\nПовремените појави на подземните води на местото на ископ и нивното испумпување предизвикува промени на движењата \\nна подземните води. \\nСогледувањата наведени во Стратегијата, упатуваат на тоа дека во случај на отсуство на отворање нови рудници за јаглен, \\nпрактично ќе дојде до намалување на негативните влијанија врз површинските и подземните води на глобално ниво. \\n \\n4. Почва \\nВлијанија врз почвата главно се јавуваат кај површинските рудници за јаглен (постоечки и евентуално отворање на нови). \\nОвие влијанија се јавуваат за време на реализација на експлоатационите активности. Тие се негативни, локални (на самото \\nексплоатационо поле) и долгорочни. Најголем ефект имаат влијанијата кои се јавуваат како резултат на директните руднички \\nископувања потребни за напредување на површинскиот коп по хоризонтала и по вертикала. \\nПокрај ова, можна е појава на лизгање на почвата како резултат на нарушување на стабилноста на косините од етажите на \\nкопот или на завршните косини по периферијата на рудникот. \\n \\n5. Отпад \\nНајголемото влијание од создавање на отпадот се јавува кај постројките за производство на електрична енергија кои користат \\nфосилни горива. Тука предводат термоелектраните на јаглен, заради огромната количина на пепел и големите количини на \\nотпадни масла. Останатите термоелектрани на фосилни горива (мазут и природен гас) го немаат проблемот со пепел, но \\nостануваат големите количини на отпадни масла и други отпадни метални делови. \\nЗначително помали количини ( а со тоа и влијанија) се создаваат кај останатите постројки за производство, пренос и \\nдистрибуција на електричната енергија (ХЕ, МХЕ, фотоволтаични, ветерници, трафостаници, електро-далноводи). Влијанието \\nод создадениот пепел е негативно, локално (депониите со пепел се во близина на термоелектраната), долгорочно и со трајни \\nефекти. Во однос на останатите видови отпад, организираното управување со него овозможува неговото влијание врз \\nживотната средина да биде сведено на минимум. \\n \\n6. Биодиверзитет \\nВлијанија врз биодиверзитетот се јавуваат кај сите видови на производство и пренос на електрична енергија, во најразлична \\nформа и со различен интензитет. Ќе наведеме неколку од нив. Кај постројките за производство на електрична енергија кои \\nкористат фосилни горива, влијанијата врз биодиверзитетот се манифестираат индиректно преку емисиите на загадувачките \\nсупстанции во воздухот NOx, SOx и цврсти честички. Овие влијанија се негативни, локални околу постројките и долгорочни. '),\n",

Тие се локални и долгорочни. Кај хидроелектраните \\nима влијанија преку зафаќање на големи површини при формирање на акумулационите езера, додека кај малите \\nхидроелектрани, обезбедување на потребниот биолошки минимум на проточна вода, влијанија врз речните екосистеми, \\nфлора и фауна, како и пределот по должината на речните корита.

Спроведување на Стратегијата ќе доведе до позитивни влијанија врз населението и тоа: \\nподобрување на квалитет на животот на граѓаните од аспект на обезбедување стабилност во снабдувањето и достапноста на \\nелектричната енергија до населението, промовирање на локалното вработување, што ќе доведе до намалување на \\nраселувањето во руралните подрачја. Овие влијанија ќе бидат позитивни, на национално ниво и долгорочни.  \\nИсто така, со спроведувањето на Стратегијата се очекува значително намалување на можните негативни влијанија врз \\nчовековото здравје, пред сé поради намалување на употребата на јаглен во производството на електрична енергија, за \\nсметка на зголемувањето на производството на електрична енергија од ОИЕ. Овие влијанија ќе бидат локални (на околното \\nнаселение) и долгорочни. \\n \\n8.

Секако дека при реализацијата на \\nпроекти наменети за производство на електрична енергија,  доколку при реализација на земјените градежни работи се утврди \\nпостоење на артефакти или се појават инциденти дека на локацијата се наоѓа потенцијално археолошко добро, градежните \\nработи ќе бидат запрени и навремено ќе биде известена Управата за културно наследство при Министертвото за култура. \\nТоплинска \\nенергија \\n1.

Оваа \\nсостојба подразбира останување на состојбите и стратешките одлуки дефинирани со \\nактуелната стратегија за развој на енергетиката во РМ до 2030 година, која пак \\nзаостанува во однос на новите случувања, обврски и достигнувања во делот на \\nенергетиката. Новините што недостасуваат и што генерално би биле поврзани со \\nпочетното сценарио без имплементација на новата стратегија  се однесуваат на \\nновата глобална тенденција со која светот се префрла на енергија со ниска употреба \\nна јаглерод. Ова следи по потпишувањето на Парискиот договор, со што светската \\nенергетска индустрија почна да се менува. Во таа насока - природниот гас како почист \\nи поодржлив извор на енергија, го истиснува јагленот од употреба, додека во исто \\nвреме обновливата енергија покажува брз раст како дел од светската енергетска \\nтрансформација.

Во споредба со нивоата во 2014 година, сите сценарија \\nпокажуваат намалување на нивото на емисии на стакленички гасови во 2030 \\nгодина, додека за 2040 година, референтното сценарио има ниво на емисии на \\nстакленички гасови слично како во 2014 година. \\n\\uf02d Во однос на пенетрацијата на ОИЕ, сите сценарија предвидуваат висок \\nпридонес на ОИЕ во бруто финалната потрошувачка на енергија. Дури и \\nреферентното сценарио ги стимулира високите количини на ОИЕ во 2030 и \\n2040 година. \\n\\uf02d Имајќи ги предвид специфичните претпоставки за развој на регионалниот пазар \\nи конкретни околности во земјата, резултатите покажуваат дека енергетската \\nтрансформација ќе создаде поволна ситуација - посилна економија, сигурно \\nснабдување со енергија и почиста животна средина при пониски трошоци за \\nенергетски систем. Зеленото сценарио има најниска вкупна системска цена во \\n2030 и 2040 година, што значи дека со ова сценарио визијата за Стратегијата \\nсе постигнува на најевтин начин. \\n\\uf02d Резултатите за емисиите на стакленички гасови и ОИЕ се во согласност со \\nиндикативните цели за 2030 година за сите три сценарија. \\n\\uf02d Во сите три сценарија, Македонија ќе користи помалку ресурси за да ги покрие \\nистите потреби. Иако се очекува дека потрошувачката на корисна енергија ќе \\nрасте, потрошувачката на финална енергија не го следи овој тренд, бидејќи во \\nсекоја од сценаријата се имплементираат поефикасни технологии \\n\\uf02d Во сите три сценарија, потрошувачката на финална енергија ќе се зголеми, но \\nсо значително пониски стапки во Умерената транзиција и зелените сценарија. \\n\\uf02d Во сите три сценарија, индустрискиот сектор е главен двигател на \\nпотрошувачката на финална енергија. Потрошувачката на финална енергија во \\nиндустријата ќе го следи планираниот економски развој на земјата. \\n\\uf02d Во сите три сценарија, електричната енергија и дизелот ќе останат клучни \\nартикли за задоволување на крајните енергетски потреби \\n\\uf02d Намалувањето на потрошувачката на јаглен е главен двигател за намалување \\nна побарувачката за примарна енергија. \\n\\uf02d Редукцијата на емисиите на стакленички гасови се постигнува во две од три \\nсценарија, што е резултат на намалувањето на искористеноста на јаглен и на \\nрударството. СО2 претставува најголем дел од емисиите на стакленички гасови \\nво сите три сценарија (~ 96% од вкупниот број). Во сценарио со умерено \\nтранзиција, емисиите на CO2 се намалуваат за речиси 30% во 2040 година во \\nоднос на 2017 година и во сценариото за 42%. За истите сценарија може да се \\nзабележи значително намалување на емисиите на CH 4, главно поради \\nелиминација на емисиите од рудниците за јаглен (без нови рудници). \\n\\uf02d Уделот на ОИЕ во вкупната потрошувачка на финална енергија се зголемува во \\nсите сценарија, доаѓајќи до 30-40% во 2040 година. \\n \\nЗаклучок: Разгледуваната алтернатива Б - да се имплементира Стратегијата е \\nприфатлива. \\n '),\n",

Следењето на \\nефектите врз животната средина и врз здравјето на луѓето од спроведувањето на \\nпланскиот документ, кога е тоа соодветно, може да се врши преку постојните државни \\nи локални мониторинг мрежи на животната средина во Република Македонија.  \\n \\nГлавна цел на мониторингот е следење на ефектите врз животната средина и врз \\nздравјето на луѓето што произлегуваат од спроведувањето на планскиот документ. Со \\nреализација на Планот за мониторинг на животната средина ќе се приберат податоци \\nкои можат да послужат за документирање на статусот на одреден медиум  на \\nживотната средина ( воздух, вода, почва) и нејзините области, како и следење на \\nефектите од применетите мерки за ублажување. Исто така, планот овозможува  \\nвоспоставување на интерактивна врска помеѓу сите вклучени страни и претставува  \\nоснова за надлежните институции, да го контролираат процесот на спроведување на \\nзаконската регулатива и да донесуваат правилни одлуки.  \\n \\nОсновните цели на Планот за мониторинг се: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Да се потврди дека договорените услови при одобрувањето на планскиот \\nдокумент се соодветно спроведени,  \\n\\uf0b7 Да се потврди дека влијанијата се во рамките на предвидените или \\nдозволените гранични вредности, \\n\\uf0b7 Да се овозможи управување со непредвидените влијанија или промени и  \\n\\uf0b7 Да се потврди дека со примена на мерките за ублажување се зголемуваат  \\nпридобивките во однос на заштитата на животната средина. \\n \\nРеализцијата на Планот за мониториг подразбира следење на соодветни индикатори \\nпреку кои ќе се согледаат остварувањата на целите на планскиот документ, како и \\nследење на промените на состојбата на медумите на животната средина како \\nрезултат на имплементацијата на планскиот документ, во согласност со законските \\nобврски. Тоа е прикажано во Табела 22. \\n \\nВо случај на согледани негативни ефекти од спроведувањето на планскиот документ \\nорганот кој го подготвува планскиот документ, друго правно и физичко лице и \\nздруженија на граѓани од областа на животната средина се должни за тоа да го \\nизвестат органот на државната управа надлежен за работите од областа на животната \\nсредина. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

These events have already caused \\nenormous damage to infrastructure, ecosystems, lives, and livelihoods, and \\ndisplaced thousands of people, and continue to be a stark reminder that it is poorer \\ncommunities—women and young people, the unemployed, those living in informal \\nsettlements—that are most vulnerable to climate change. Climate change also \\nplaces significant stress on food security and South Africa’s already-constrained \\nwater resources, creating knock-on impacts in other sectors (DFFE 2019; NPC 2020).  \\n \\nClimate change exacerbates South Africa’s triple challenges of poverty, \\nunemployment, and inequality. South Africa is one of the most unequal countries in \\nthe world; the divide between the rich and the poor is larger than ever; currently, \\nthe unemployment rate, at over 35 percent, is at record levels (StatsSA 2022). The \\nhealth impacts from the burning of fossil fuels (a major driver of climate change) also \\nimpacts poorer communities, further highlighting these inequities (Gray 2019; \\nMadonsela et al. 2022). The PCC’s community engagements in the early part of \\n2022 identified the hardships that many South Africans are experiencing. Workers, \\njobseekers, and community members have spoken passionately and articulately \\nabout the unfairness of their current situations, the inequalities they experience, and \\ntheir visions for a more equal and more inclusive society (PCC 2022a). At the same \\ntime the capacity of the state to respond to these challenges has never been \\nweaker, and communities have expressed the view that the state is failing them. \\n \\nIt is in South Africa’s national interests to join the world in combating climate change, \\nin accordance with national circumstances and development priorities. This is not \\nonly an environmental imperative, but an economic one too, as countries around \\nthe world start to shift toward low-emissions policies, affecting global trade as well as \\ndemand for goods and resources.  \\n \\nAddressing climate change means strengthening adaptation measures to improve \\nthe resilience to immediate events (e.g., extreme weather, disasters) as well as long-\\nterm climatic shifts that impact water security, food security, and human health \\n(DFFE 2019), with a particular focus on vulnerable groups, particularly rural \\ncommunities, the poor, women, the youth, and children. Addressing climate change \\nalso necessitates sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions—the harmful \\npollutants that drive climate change. The scale of the challenge also demands an \\neffective State, significant government capacity, and trust among all stakeholders, \\nwhich has been significantly eroded in recent years because of the loss of \\naccountability and professional ethos linked to state capture (The Presidency 2022).  \\n \\nTackling climate change will require urgent, significant, and transformational \\nchanges across all sectors of the South African economy. It will require innovations in \\nurban and infrastructure planning; a massive shift to clean energy sources; and '),\n",

The \\nchanges will be difficult for some, particularly the workers and communities whose \\nlives and livelihoods are tied to fossil fuel industries, as well as the women, the youth, \\nand the poor, who are already disproportionately bearing the brunt of South Africa’s \\nhardships and triple challenges. Managing the transition will require strategies that \\nboth deal with the unavoidable burdens arising from the transition, as well as \\nstrategies that seize the opportunities offered by the green economy, with wide \\nsharing of benefits.  \\n \\nPeople must be at the centre of the climate change response (ILO 2015; DFFE 2022). \\nIndeed, the aim is a just transition: seizing the opportunities and managing the risks \\nassociated with climate change, with an overarching goal of improving the lives \\nand livelihoods of ALL South Africans, particularly those most impacted. The scope of \\na just transition is wide, both in the focus on people, and on the time scales of action \\nand delivery. \\n \\nAbout the Just Transition Framework \\n \\nWhat is the Just Transition Framework? \\n \\nOne of the first tasks of the Presidential Climate Commission (PCC) was to design a \\njust transition framework for South Africa. In December 2020, President Cyril \\nRamaphosa created the PCC to oversee and facilitate a just transition to a low-\\nemissions and climate-resilient economy. The just transition framework is the first \\nbuilding block towards this objective, bringing coordination and coherence to just \\ntransition planning in the country. The just transition framework sets out a shared \\nvision for the just transition, principles to guide the transition, and policies and \\ngovernance arrangements to give effect to the transition.  \\n \\nHow was the Just Transition Framework Developed? \\n \\nThe just transition framework builds on research, policies, and consultations on the \\njust transition in South Africa, as well as international best practice guidelines. The \\nframework stands on the shoulders of years of research in South Africa on the just \\ntransition, done by government, business, civil society, academia, and labour \\nunions. The framework incorporates learnings from prior consultation processes on \\nthe just transition, including those facilitated by the National Planning Commission \\n(NPC 2019) and the National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC \\n2020).

Foundations for a Just Transition Framework \\n \\nThe work on just transitions in South Africa dates back more than a decade, first \\noriginating with the labour movement. In 2009, at the tenth national congress, the \\nCongress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) highlighted the importance of a \\njust transition to “protect the most vulnerable from the effects of climate change” \\n(COSATU 2009). COSATU built on this definition in its 2011 climate change policy \\npaper, explicitly calling for a just transition to a low-carbon economy, where the “just \\ntransition” focused on mitigating transition impacts on working-class groups, \\nincluding workers, communities, and small businesses (COSATU 2011).  \\n \\nThe focus on achieving a just transition soon followed from national government. In \\n2011, the National Climate Change Response White Paper emphasised a just \\ntransition as a policy imperative and an essential part of an effective climate \\nchange response (DEA 2011). In 2012, South Africa adopted a National \\nDevelopment Plan (NDP) after an extensive consultation process, with a focus on \\nenvironmental sustainability and charting an equitable transition to a low-carbon \\neconomy (NDP 2012). The NPC also engaged in social dialogues between 2017 and \\n2019 on the just transition, in all provinces and among a variety of stakeholders, \\nincluding the youth and energy-intensive users (NPC 2019). In December 2020, \\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa established the PCC (originally named the Presidential \\nClimate Change Coordinating Commission), with an explicit aim to “advise on and \\nfacilitate a common understanding of a just transition, cognisant of the socio-\\neconomic, environmental and technological implications of climate change” (The \\nPresidency 2020). South Africa’s Draft Climate Change Act also includes the just \\ntransition imperative as part of the overarching objectives and principles guiding \\nSouth Africa’s response to climate change (DFFE 2022). \\n \\nGovernment departments have advanced the just transition agenda. For example, \\nthe Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) was instrumental in \\ncreating the National Employment Vulnerability Assessment (Makgetla et al. 2019) \\nand Sector Jobs Resilience Plans (Makgetla et al. 2020c); the Department of Mineral \\nResources and Energy (DMRE) has engaged in several scoping studies and \\ndeveloped a draft just energy transition plan (DMRE 2020); National Treasury has \\ncreated working groups focused on climate change and the just transition, as well \\nas deepened work on financing a sustainable economy (National Treasury 2021; \\nNational Treasury 2022). The Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (dtic) \\nhas developed a roadmap for the local production of electric vehicle and \\ncomponents in South Africa (dtic 2021); the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) \\nhas developed a roadmap for Eskom as part of a reformed electricity industry (DPE \\n2019). \\n \\nThe just transition imperative has now been entrenched and embraced by most \\nmajor stakeholder groups in South Africa. There is broad consensus among social \\npartners that climate change will impact people and the economy, and that a just \\ntransition to a sustainable, cleaner, and more inclusive economy is required (PCC \\n2022b). All social partners are clear that a just transition should protect constituents, '),\n",

Defining a Just Transition for South Africa \\n \\nThe framework is guided by a shared definition of a just transition in South Africa. The \\ndefinition builds on the work done by NEDLAC (NEDLAC 2019), the National Planning \\nCommission (NPC 2020), the definition articulated in the draft Climate Change Bill \\n(DFFE 2022), and the views expressed in the stakeholder consultations and \\ncommunity engagements facilitated by the PCC (PCC 2022a; 2022b).  \\n \\nThe definition for a just transition, put forward in this framework, is therefore as follows: \\n \\nA just transition aims to achieve a quality life for all South Africans, in the context of \\nclimate resilient and net-zero-emissions development. \\n \\nA just transition contributes to the goals of decent work for all, social inclusion, and \\nthe eradication of poverty. \\n \\nA just transition puts people at the centre of decision making, especially those most \\nimpacted, the poor, women, people with disabilities, and the youth—empowering \\nand equipping them for new opportunities of the future. \\n \\nA just transition builds the resilience of the economy and people through affordable, \\ndecentralised, diversely owned renewable energy systems; conservation of natural \\nresources; equitable access of water resources; and sustainable, equitable, inclusive \\nland-use for all, especially for the most vulnerable. \\n \\n3. Principles  \\n \\nThe Bill of Rights, set out in Chapter 2 of the South African Constitution, enshrines first \\ngeneration democratic and political rights, along with second generation socio-\\neconomic rights (e.g., shelter, health care, food, water and social services) and third \\ngeneration collective development rights (e.g., environment and sustainable \\ndevelopment, rights to collective organization and economic activities, rights of \\ncultural and linguistic communities). These rights are given further expression in \\nChapter 1 of the National Environment Management Act (Act 107 of 1998), which \\ncontains a justiciable set of principles including putting human development \\nconcerns at the centre of decision making, producer and polluter responsibility, \\nequitable access to environmental resources, and equipping people to participate \\nin decision making.  \\n \\nIn building on these progressive principles, this framework advances three principles \\nas underpinning a just transition towards an environmentally sustainable economy '),\n",

These principles are drawn from literature on the just transition (Cahill and \\nAllen 2020; McCauley and Heffron 2018), consultations facilitated by the PCC (PCC \\n2022a, 2022b), and international best practice guidelines (ILO 2015, 2021). \\n \\nThe theme of environmental justice also underlies all these principles—increasing the \\nresilience of people and the environment to climate impacts. Resilience can be \\nincreased by, for example, protecting South Africa’s strategic water sources areas, \\nimproving ecosystem services, improving biodiversity, implementing sustainable \\nland-use practices, and restoring ecosystems to their natural forms, among other \\nactivities (Beukman & Reeler 2021; SANBI 2018). \\n \\n3.1. Distributive Justice \\n \\nThe risks and opportunities resulting from the transition must be distributed fairly, \\ncognisant of gender, race, and class inequalities. It is essential that impacted \\nworkers and communities do not carry the overall burden of the transition, and the \\ncosts of adjustment are borne by those historically responsible for the problem.  \\n \\nThe principle of distributive justice can be embodied in South Africa by: \\n• Equipping South Africans with skills, assets, and opportunities to participate in \\nindustries of the future, with particular attention on impacted groups, the poor, \\nwomen, people with disabilities, and the youth. \\n• Implementing transformative national economic and social policies that clearly \\nconsider how benefits and burdens will be distributed (this includes clear \\nindication of where jobs are gained, where jobs are lost, and the quality and \\nlongevity of future employment). \\n• Increasing provincial and local capacity (both resources and skills) to promote \\nlocal economic development. \\n• Ensuring corporate responsibility to support a green and inclusive economy. \\n \\n3.2. Restorative Justice \\n \\nHistorical damages against individuals, communities, and the environment must be \\naddressed, with a particular focus on rectifying or ameliorating the situations of \\nharmed or disenfranchised communities. It is about redress: healing people and the \\nland, which was an immediate need echoed by all communities that the PCC has \\nconsulted with (PCC 2022a). \\n \\nThe principle of restorative justice can be embodied in South Africa by: \\n• Acknowledging the health and environmental impacts to communities in coal \\nand other fossil fuel impacted areas, and supporting all South Africans’ \\nconstitutional rights to a healthy environment. \\n• Shifting away from resource intensive sectors and fossil fuels to (1) improve \\necosystems with community ownership and stewardship, (2) improve energy \\nsecurity and eliminate energy poverty, and (3) create opportunities for '),\n",

Procedural Justice \\n \\nWorkers, communities, and small businesses must be empowered and supported in \\nthe transition, with them defining their own development and livelihoods. It is about \\nembracing the sentiment, “nothing about us without us!” (PCC 2022b). \\n \\nThe principle of procedural justice can be embodied in South Africa by: \\n• Assisting communities to understand what the just transition entails, specifically, \\nand discuss points of agreement and disagreement openly and transparently. \\n• Supporting worker and community organisations (unions, civics, advocacy \\ngroups, etc.) to participate actively in just transition policy-making processes \\nensuring decisions are made in their best interests and allow them to take \\nadvantage of opportunities. \\n• Collaborating actively with a range of stakeholders, through inclusive and \\nparticipatory decision-making structures, allowing each to play to their \\nrespective strengths, fostering a more dynamic, competitive, diversified, and \\nequitable economy. \\n• Supporting the design and implementation of just transition projects, as proposed \\nby individuals and communities in affected areas. \\n \\n4. At-Risk Value Chains and Sectors \\n \\nAn effective just transition demands an understanding of the working people and \\ncommunities that are (1) negatively impacted by climate change i.e., when their \\nlives and livelihoods are directly impacted by droughts, floods, and other extreme \\nweather events or other long-term climate impacts (e.g. food security risks, water \\nscarcity) and/or (2) negatively impacted by the sectoral shifts in response to climate \\nchange i.e., when their means of securing income and work are tied to high-\\nemissions industries that are phased out over time.  \\n \\nThis framework begins by focusing on four sectors and value chains that are at-risk in \\nthe transition, which form part of the formal economy: (1) the coal value chain, (2) \\nthe auto value chain, (3) agriculture, and (4) tourism, as a first illustration of these \\nrisks. These analyses draw on earlier work done in preparing South Africa’s National \\nEmployment Vulnerability Assessment (Makgetla et al. 2019) and Sector Jobs \\nResilience Plans (Patel et al. 2020; Maseko et al. 2020; Makgetla et al. 2020a; \\nMakgetla et al. 2020b) but are not exhaustive.  \\n '),\n",

This work must include a spatial \\nlens—considering spatial disparity as an important binding constraint in South \\nAfrica’s inclusive development and resilience to shocks, including climate shocks. \\nSouth Africa’s spatial exclusion, rooted in the apartheid legacy (e.g., in the form of \\ntownships and informal settlements on marginal and vulnerable lands), continue to \\ndisadvantage certain groups, undermining both the resilience of affected \\ncommunities and the urban dividend in South Africa’s development.  \\n \\n4.1. Coal Value Chain  \\n \\nThe coal value chain in South Africa faces one of the earliest disruptions in the global \\ntransition towards reaching net-zero emissions. Demand for coal for electricity and \\nexports shrunk in the 2010s and is expected to decline further in the long term as \\ncountries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (Patel et al. 2020). Projections from \\nthe International Energy Agency show an increase in global coal demand through \\n2024, and then plateauing. Coal consumption will need to decline quickly and \\nsharply thereafter to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement (IEA 2021). This will \\ncreate significant risks in South Africa, including revenue loss from reduced coal \\nexports; job losses across the coal value chain; and loss of the economic ecosystems \\naround coal mining communities, potentially creating ghost towns without effective \\neconomic diversification. \\n \\nThe sector will also face risks from the impacts of climate change. Coal production \\nrequires a significant amount of water, and climate change is likely to increase \\nwater scarcity and competition throughout South Africa (Beukman and Reeler \\n2021). Mining operations for coal and other products are also vulnerable to \\nincreased temperatures and extreme weather events, so it is important for the \\ntransition process to look at adaption pathways to reduce risk along the value chain \\nand to communities in mining areas (NBI 2021b). \\n \\nDownstream users of coal—Eskom, Sasol (which also mines its own coal) and the \\nelectricity-intensive aluminium and ferro-alloys producers—can reduce risks to their \\noperations and sustain their employment if they develop alternative non-fossil fuel \\nsources of energy and transition to new low-emissions production models (Makgetla \\n2021b). In contrast, the coal mines, together with their suppliers and communities, \\nwill face downsizing from around 2025 (Makgetla 2021b). The challenge will be to \\nenable them to transition their business operating models, as seamlessly as possible, \\nand for local and regional economies in these areas to design development plans \\nfor growth, employment creation, and decent new livelihoods.  \\n  \\nThe coal industry directly employed around 93,000 people in 2021 (Minerals Council \\nSouth Africa 2022). From the 1980s to early 2000s employment in the sector declined \\nfrom its peak of roughly 130,000 jobs to its lowest point of around 50,000 jobs before \\nrising to 90,000 in the 2010s (Makgetla 2021b). Future projections suggest declines, \\ndriven externally by reduced global demand for South African coal exports, \\npotentially exacerbated by domestic trends to automation and the digital economy '),\n",

Most miners have matric qualifications yet \\nearn around 50 percent more than the median for the formal sector. This makes it \\nharder to find equivalent livelihoods outside of mining (Makgetla 2021b).  \\n \\nCoal production is geographically concentrated with 80 percent occurring in \\nMpumalanga and over 70 percent of South Africa’s total value added from coal \\ncoming from just four towns— eMalahleni (Witbank), Steve Tshwete (Middelburg), \\nGovan Mbeki and Msukaligwa (Ermelo) (Patel et al. 2020; Makgetla 2021b). Around \\n1.1 million people live in these districts (Stats SA 2011). Besides the direct employment \\neffects, the downsizing in coal will affect a range of businesses and informal sector \\nwork that support the mines’ labour force. Moreover, the municipalities depend on \\nEskom and the mines to provide some infrastructure and services (Patel et al. 2020).  \\n \\nWith appropriate planning and support, some of the job losses in the coal value \\nchain can be offset by further development of the domestic renewable energy \\nmanufacturing industry. The Draft South African Renewable Energy Masterplan \\n(SAREM) outlines some of the potential benefits that can be realized by industrialising \\nthe renewable energy value chain, including targeted job creation in areas where \\nformer coal sector employees live (DMRE, dtic and DSI 2022). As the SAREM is \\naligned with the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), any updates to the IRP that \\nincrease the renewable energy targets for 2030 or beyond would likely result in \\nincreases to the projected job and GDP growth potential of the plan.  \\n \\n4.2. Auto Value Chain  \\n \\nThe auto industry depends on exports to Europe and the United States, which have \\ncommitted to accelerating the introduction of electric vehicles (EVs) (Maseko et al. \\n2020; European Parliament 2022; The White House 2021). If the South African auto \\nindustry does not keep up with this global transition, local producers risk exclusion \\nfrom these crucial markets. Production of EVs, however, requires far fewer inputs and \\njobs than petroleum-based cars, though jobs may be created to develop the \\ninfrastructure for charging stations, as well as the activities flowing from battery \\nmanagement (e.g., safe disposal, recycling, and refurbishment) (Maseko et al. \\n2020). The timeframes for the transition away from petroleum-based transport \\ndepend largely on developments in the global North and, to a lesser extent, \\nregional markets. Europe and the United States have committed to mass use of EVs \\nby 2030 (European Parliament 2022; The White House 2021). A reduction in demand \\nfor petrol and diesel will also have knock-on impacts for the liquid fuels sector. \\n \\nCurrently, around 100,000 people work in auto manufacturing (Maseko et al. 2020). \\nThe industry centres on Tshwane, eThekwini, Nelson Mandela Bay and Buffalo City \\n(Maseko et al. 2020). The Eastern Cape could face particularly harsh outcomes \\nunless the province is able to develop alternative production clusters (Maseko et al. \\n2020). The largest employment impacts will be in support industries rather than auto \\nproduction itself. Around 250,000 people work as auto mechanics, over a third in the \\ninformal sector (Maseko et al. 2020). Informal mechanics are predominantly self-\\nemployed. An additional 250,000 people are taxi owners and drivers; this group will '),\n",

It is \\nnot yet clear how petrol stations will adapt. They make much of their profits on retail \\nsales but rely on petrol to attract customers (Makgetla et al. 2019). Petrol stations \\nemploy around 130,000 people and just over half of employees have matric \\n(Makgetla et al. 2019).  \\n \\nWhile the global transition towards net-zero emissions creates risks to the auto value \\nchain, there are also opportunities. The Department of Trade, Industry and \\nCompetition’s draft Auto Green Paper on the Advancement of New Energy \\nVehicles in South Africa lays out a policy framework for advancing the EV market, \\namong others, with interventions including tax reforms to stimulate greater domestic \\ndemand for EVs as well as an EV industrialisation strategy (dtic 2021).  \\n \\n4.3. Agriculture   \\n \\nAgriculture is a labour-intensive sector both in terms of employment per unit of \\noutput and in terms of its potential as an employment multiplier. Agriculture has \\nalready begun to experience the impacts of increasingly volatile weather, with ever-\\ndeeper fluctuations in production through the 2010s (DFFE 2019). The sector has \\nfaced persistent droughts in some areas; shifts in seasonal rainfall; intense rainfalls, \\nwhich caused floods and, especially in labour-sending regions, worsened erosion; \\nand generally higher temperatures and humidity, affecting farmworkers, affecting \\nanimals and crops directly, as well as incubating new pests and increasing water \\ndemand (DFFE 2019). These trends will intensify over the coming years. Climate \\nchange is also likely to create permanent changes in the suitability of regions to \\nproduce different crops in South Africa. \\n \\nClimate-induced changes in water availability are likely to have the most immediate \\nand significant impact on the sector. Agriculture accounts for over sixty percent of \\nall water usage in South Africa (Beukman and Reeler 2021). The extent to which \\nfarmers can more efficiently use water and adopt other climate adaptive practices \\nand technologies will significantly influence impacts on the sector. Commercial \\nfarmers have begun to invest in more resilient infrastructure and crops, such as \\nshade for orchards, drip irrigation and heat-resistant varieties (Chisoro-Dube and \\nRoberts 2021). Many smallholder farmers, however, lack the resources to invest in \\nclimate-smart approaches without support from the government or financial \\nincentive schemes (Beukman and Reeler 2021). \\n \\nThe difference in adaptive capacity between commercial and smallholder farmers \\nis representative of the power dynamics in the sector. The agricultural value chain is \\nhighly concentrated, with relatively few agro-industrial farms producing most \\nproducts; roughly 50,000 industrial farms were responsible for over 90 percent of \\nagricultural products sold in formal retail outlets in the 2010s and around 70 percent \\nof all agricultural income is earned by less than 7 percent of farms (Makgetla et al. \\n2020a; NBI 2021a). Labour force surveys suggest that around a quarter of formal farm \\nowners are black and black farmers account for just five person of water use '),\n",

Moreover, \\nthey often live on isolated settlements on farms, making it harder for them to \\norganise or to find new livelihoods. Under 5 percent are union members (Makgetla \\net al. 2019). Because droughts affect seasonal workers (around half of the total) \\nparticularly severely, it proves difficult to track their employment effects (Makgetla et \\nal. 2019). The outcomes appear, not as retrenchments, but as a failure to hire \\ntemporary workers, which farmers do not have to report.   \\n \\nMedian earnings for farmworkers came to R2,500 a month for women in 2017, and \\nR2,800 for men. For other formal employees, the median earnings for women were \\nR4,000 a month, and R5,000 for men (Makgetla et al. 2019). The median woman \\nfarmworker earned a little over half than her counterpart in other formal industries, \\nwhile the median man earned 63 percent. The gender pay gap in farming, while \\napparent, is lower than in the rest of the economy (Makgetla et al. 2019).  \\n \\nIn historic labour-sending regions, about 1.7 million people are engaged in farming \\nor gardening and roughly 154,000 depend on it as their primary income or food \\nsource (Makgetla et al. 2020a) Most do not have matric. In contrast to commercial \\nfarms, almost none have capital or access to financing for more resilient production \\ntechnologies (Makgetla et al. 2019). Small-scale farmers in the labour-sending \\nregions usually have no alternative employment opportunities nearby, which is \\nparticularly acute for women subsistence farmers (Makgetla et al. 2019).  \\n \\nThere are, however, opportunities to stimulate new and decent work in agriculture, \\nwhile at the same time reducing greenhouse gas emissions, more efficiently using \\nwater resources, and improving rural livelihoods. For example, the restoration of \\ndegraded lands, the improvement of biodiversity, and/or the implementation of \\nclimate-smart agriculture are job creators, while bringing important climate and \\nenvironmental benefits. The empowerment of community-based organisations to \\nimplement micro-projects will also support climate and broader societal resilience, \\nparticularly in rural or labour-sending regions. The agriculture sector will also benefit \\nenormously from successful global climate change mitigation, since the most severe \\nimpacts of climate change on agriculture will be avoided if global warming can be \\nrestricted to well below 2°C. \\n \\n4.4. Tourism \\n \\nTourism faces a variety of pressures because of climate change. Climate-driven \\ndegradation and disruption to cultural and natural heritage negatively affects the \\ntourism sector, reduces the attractiveness of destinations, and lessens the economic \\nopportunities for local communities. This is because natural and cultural resources \\nare the foundation for the tourism sector’s competitiveness, some of which are \\nthreatened by increasing heat, droughts, and rainfall (Makgetla et al. 2020b).

Adverse global \\npublicity around water shortages in Cape Town during the 2016 drought also saw a \\nmarked fall in visitors, with only a slow recovery (Makgetla et al. 2020b). In addition, \\noverseas tourism—a small but highly lucrative part of the market—faces growing \\npressure from efforts to reduce emissions from long-distance air travel (Makgetla et \\nal. 2020b). It is not clear how this trend will affect foreign tourism to South Africa, or \\nover what timeframes.  \\n \\nData on tourism are always problematic, because the sector does not report as a \\nseparate category in the national accounts. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic led \\nto sharp downsizing in 2020, making it harder to discern trends (Stats SA 2021). In \\n2018, there were nearly 600,000 employees in catering and accommodation (a \\nlarge proportion of these women), and an estimated 700,000 in the sector (Makgetla \\net al. 2020b).  Two thirds of both employees and businesses were in Gauteng, the \\nWestern Cape and KwaZulu Natal (Makgetla et al. 2019).  \\n \\nResponsible tourism (as set out in the National Minimum Standard for Responsible \\nTourism (SANS 1162) can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve energy and \\nwater, reduce waste and plastic consumption and ensure that fair benefits accrue \\nto communities and employees (Department of Tourism n.d.) \\n \\n4.5. Phases and Timeframes for Impacts \\n \\nThe phases of the climate transition will be marked by steadily increasing global \\nmean temperatures with associated physical impacts, alongside the increasing \\nurgency of the global mitigation response. In the next five years (2021 – 2025), the \\nglobal energy transition will accelerate, with increasing pressure on disinvestment in \\nfossil fuels. By 2030 a global carbon price will be established, with constraints on \\nemissions entrenched in trading systems, as countries move to prevent carbon \\nleakage. In developed countries, the production of the internal combustion engine \\nwill be phased out, and fossil fuel markets will enter a more rapid decline. We will \\nalso see more extreme weather events with harmful impacts on people’s health and \\nlivelihoods, and consequential impacts on tourism, agriculture, transport, and trade. \\nAnticipating these changes allows us to develop a broad phasing for the transition, \\nas it impacts particularly at-risk value chains and sectors.

Seizing Opportunities in the Different Phases of the Transition \\n \\nWhile the projected impacts in select at-risk value chains and sectors are extremely \\nconcerning, it is important to recognise that there are also significant opportunities in \\nthe transition—to improve the well-being of the economy, where people live and \\nwork in meaningful and positive relationships with each other and the planet. \\n \\nIn an ideal case, when seizing the opportunities presented by a greener economy \\nwhile managing and mitigating all risks: \\n \\n• In the 2021-2025 period there will be soaring demand and financing for \\nrenewable energy, with associated technology advances and new employment \\nand livelihood opportunities. Coal stakeholders and communities will be actively \\nseeking opportunities for economic diversification. There will also be increasing \\ndomestic and international demand for more climate resilient agriculture, \\ninfrastructure, and housing, and for cleaner transport.  \\n \\n• As the transition accelerates in the period 2025-2030, very rapid investment will \\ntake place in new transmission lines and technologies for power generation and \\nstorage. More reliable and cheaper electricity will promote a more sustainable \\neconomy and job creation, while there will be growing international and \\ndomestic markets for e-vehicles and other technologies to reduce emissions and \\nimprove resilience, which South Africa is well placed to respond to. Investments \\nwill seek to diversify economies in coal-dependent communities, and there is the \\nprospect of greater urban densification which reduces commuter and labour \\ncosts and increases housing demand, thus creating new economies.  \\n \\n• Beyond 2030, there will be a more affordable and reliable electricity system, and \\nother innovative investments which lay the basis for a more dynamic, diversified, \\nand equitable economy. Renewable energy production will make electricity \\ncheaper and more dependable and will create new manufacturing and \\nmaintenance jobs. This will have positive knock-on effects on energy-dependent \\neconomic sectors, including mining, cement, and manufacturing. Investments in \\nelectric vehicles and hydrogen will equip South Africa to meet the global clean \\nenergy future. The clean energy transition will also open new markets for the \\nsupply of other minerals, like platinum, vanadium, cobalt, copper, manganese, \\nand lithium, opening new export opportunities. Climate-smart agriculture could \\ncreate better yields and more resilient crops, improving food security and the \\nlives and livelihoods of small-scale farmers. \\n \\nClear and determined governance responses are necessary to seize these \\nopportunities and support a just transition. Over the next five years, systems must be \\nestablished to ensure consistent and vigorous responses to climate change across \\nthe state while building partnerships with stakeholders, with clear mandates and \\nmonitoring systems. Support must be initiated for community mobilisation and \\ncapacity to implement just transition strategies. There must be clear political support \\nfor and implementation of an accelerated renewable energy build at a scale that \\nallows for local manufacturing chains to develop, supported by an updated IRP.

Affected municipalities (mining, farming, and tourism towns) must be \\nidentified and capacitated, while community and worker organisations need the \\nresources and forums to collaborate productively with government and business.  \\n \\nBy 2030 increasingly mature systems and structures must integrate just transition \\nstrategies across government and stakeholder practice, while stakeholder \\nmobilisation and improved state capacity to deal with climate change should \\nunderpin stronger participatory democracy and industrial policy. \\n \\n5. Key Policy Areas for a Just Transition \\n \\nThe following policy areas constitute a basic framework to address the challenges of \\na just transition for all South Africans, drawn from work done by the ILO (2015), \\nMontmasson-Clair (2021), and Patel (2021), among others. These policies should be \\napplied in an integrated manner and aligned so that policies in one field do not \\nundermine objectives and measures in other policy fields. \\n \\n5.1. Human Resource Development and Skills Development \\n \\nSouth Africa faces deep-seated structural challenges in the economy, centred on \\nunusually profound inequality and high levels of unemployment. As a result, affected \\ngroups may not be able to shift into new opportunities in the climate transition. Skills \\ndevelopment and education is therefore essential to respond to the transition risk \\nand support people in becoming more climate resilient.  \\n \\nRecommendations in this framework are focused on three broad areas: (1) reskilling \\nand upskilling existing adult workers so that they are better equipped to navigate \\nthe transition; (2) aligning the skills development system with the anticipated labour \\nforce needs of the future, particularly focused on green jobs to support a just \\ntransition; and (3) ensuring foundational skills through the education system to \\nimprove the adaptative capacity of the broader workforce. Many of these reforms \\nare set out in the White Paper for Post-School Education and Training (DHET 2014), \\nwhich envision an effective post-school education system that is youth-focused and \\nadult user-friendly and strongly linked to the world of work. \\n \\nReskilling/upskilling affected adult workers to support a just transition: \\n• Providing training to workers in the formal sector (e.g., courses, workplace-based \\nlearning opportunities) to facilitate movement into new career pathways, based \\non existing education and skill levels, and with effective mechanisms for \\nrecognising prior learning \\n• Providing training in the informal sector, with focus on overcoming barriers to skills \\ndevelopment given typically lower levels of foundational skills  '),\n",

Industrial Development, Economic Diversification, and Innovation \\n \\nIndustrial development and economic diversification are essential to supporting a \\njust and equitable transition. New economic clusters will be needed to create new \\njobs and replace jobs where they may be lost. These clusters can be designed to \\nmeet local needs, for instance, by producing local necessities such as food, \\nconstruction materials, entertainment, education, or healthcare; alternatively, these \\nclusters can provide products for regional or global markets. Rising numbers of small \\nand informal business are critical for a more resilient and equitable economy.  \\n \\nNew economic clusters need not only be thought of in the context of energy or \\nindustry, but also in terms of the “biodiversity economy,” which encompasses \\nbusinesses and other economic activities that either directly depend on biodiversity \\nfor their core business, or that contribute to the conservation of biodiversity through \\ntheir activities. The biodiversity economy, for example generates over 418,000 jobs in \\nSouth Africa (SANBI 2018), with jobs in sectors such as the restoration of biodiversity, \\nfisheries, wildlife ranching, biodiversity-based tourism, traditional medicine, and \\nindigenous tea production. Many of the biodiversity-related jobs are outside the \\nurban centres and are labour intensive, contributing to rural development, poverty \\nalleviation, inclusive growth, and labour absorption (SANBI 2018). \\n \\nImportantly, the new economic clusters and opportunities should account for the \\nspatial disparities that exist in South Africa and try to address those intrinsic \\nchallenges. These new opportunities must not entrench existing inequalities.   \\n \\nEconomic diversification can be achieved by: \\n• Improving support (income and relocation) for formal small and medium \\nenterprises, as well as the informal / so-called “hustle” economy, which \\nconstitutes the main livelihood strategy for many unemployed people in affected \\nareas \\n• Providing or facilitating financing, sites, and inputs for new small and micro \\nenterprises, ideally as part of a strategy to promote local economic \\ndiversification \\n• Resolving blockages to economic diversification through holistic approaches \\nthat address limited assets and financing; poor quality or expensive infrastructure; \\na lack of suitable retail or industrial sites; poor access to market outlets; \\nexcessively priced inputs; and/or inadequate education, skills, and experience \\n• Identifying viable new economic clusters, considering the strengths and \\ndisadvantages of individual communities; proposals should be reviewed to '),\n",

Innovation in the South African \\neconomy may include: \\n• Developing competitive industries to produce inputs and support services \\n(design, engineering, and maintenance) for green technologies, including \\nrenewable energy inputs, battery cells, e-vehicles, green hydrogen, and net-\\nzero-emissions cement or cement alternatives, all of which may target domestic, \\nregional, and where viable overseas markets \\n• Developing innovative technologies that improve climate resilience, such as \\nregenerative agriculture and artificial wetlands \\n• Promoting the circular economy, including as a job creator \\n• Establishing regulatory frameworks that promote new technologies, including by \\nchanging regulations that restrict them unnecessarily (as in the case of \\nrenewable energy for electricity) \\n• Setting technical standards that enable and encourage new technologies \\n• Ensuring the South African National System of Innovation is “climate-aware” and \\nfosters innovations which support net-zero-emissions, climate-resilient activities \\n• Disseminating information about new technologies, including their up-front \\nfinancial and technological requirements and longer-term viability \\n• Managing lobbying from established producers that aim to protect older, \\nuncompetitive production sites, and resist technological change and innovation \\n• Stimulating technological advances that can generate employment and \\nbroaden ownership of productive assets, to support a just transition \\n• Balancing support for innovation between large companies/enterprises and \\nsmall and medium businesses/cooperatives, in a manner that considers both the \\naim of greater inclusion and the realities of power, capacity, and historic \\nresponsibility \\n \\n5.3. Social Protection Measures \\n \\nWhile some workers and communities may be able to transition to new jobs and \\nindustries, others will require transitional or long-term support according to their \\nunique situations. Support for the chronically poor and unemployed (i.e., through the \\nsocial security system) may differ from transitional mechanisms to support those \\naffected by longer-term sectoral changes in the economy or by immediate climate-\\nrelated disasters.

The Department of Social Security has proposed a \\ncomprehensive reform of social security and retirement provisions (DSD 2021), and \\nfurther work is being undertaken to define the scope and structure of these social \\nprotection measures in the context of South Africa’s fiscal constraints. \\n \\nIn considering comprehensive social security reform, it is important to factor in the \\nrequirements for social support within the climate transition. Security of those \\naffected by the transition will be significantly enhanced by basic income support \\nand mandatory retirement and disability provision provided through a national \\nsocial security fund. Workers and communities in affected sectors and regions should \\nbe eligible for income support, regardless of their income or assets. Such sectoral \\nand regional measures could form an initial step towards a comprehensive social \\nprotection floor.  \\n \\nProviding comprehensive social security nets for displaced workers and communities \\nwill ensure they have adequate resources to survive while they develop a new \\nlivelihood (per the mechanisms outlined in section 5.1). Social protection measures \\n(e.g., social grants, unemployment insurance, stipends for formal education or \\napprenticeships) must be targeted at and reach vulnerable groups, particularly \\nwomen and young people, and be integrated with education, training, and active \\nlabour market policies. The social support should include mechanisms that promote \\nentrepreneurship and self-employment, where possible, complemented by social \\nprotection funds for a specified period \\n \\nSpecific measures are required for shock responsive social protection for the \\npoor/vulnerable who experience a climate-induced shock to income/assets and \\nneed temporary help to get back on their feet. This could take the form of a \\npermanent, time bound, Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant-type fund that is \\ntriggered in cases of climate-related disasters \\n \\nIn addition, individuals and communities will require support to enhance their \\nclimate resilience. This includes resilience to near-term impacts like floods, droughts, \\nextreme storms, as well as long-term impacts that reduce water availability and food \\nsecurity. As set out in the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (DFFE 2019), \\nactivities to enhance the resilience of vulnerable individuals and communities to \\nreduce impacts of climate-induced shocks will include: \\n• Identifying communities at greatest risk for impacts of climate change (e.g., \\nthose residing in low-lying river basins, coastal communities, poorly designed \\ninformal settlements, etc.) and applying targeted interventions to minimise \\nimpacts \\n• “Climate-proofing” physical infrastructure, such as roads and stormwater systems, \\nwith an added benefit of being a local job creator, which includes proper \\nplanning \\n• In line with the Integrated Urban Development Framework (COGTA 2016), \\ndesigning more compact, connected cities, which includes addressing housing \\nand proximity to jobs in South African cities and improving public services \\n(especially transport, electricity and water and waste services) to build resilience \\nof poor and vulnerable communities '),\n",

Effective Governance for a Just Transition \\n \\nThe imperative of a just transition in not only set within the context of low economic \\ngrowth, existing social inequality, environmental degradation, and increasing \\nseverity of extreme weather events, but also in the context of a severely weakened \\nstate in South Africa. State capture, the loss of capable managers, erosion of \\naccountability, and lack of professionalism, has severely hampered the ability of the \\nstate to implement good governance at all tiers (The Presidency 2022). \\n \\nEffective governance at the national, provincial, and municipal levels will therefore \\nbe central to achieving a just and equitable transition in South Africa—implementing \\nplans, building consensus, mobilising resources (importantly, avoiding decisions/ \\ninvestments that are not aligned with the just transition), coordinating \\nimplementation, and monitoring progress. The nature of climate risks and the \\nurgency of the transition is such that stakeholders must work intentionally, in concert. \\nMainstreaming the just transition imperative in planning and budgeting is a \\ncrosscutting issue that requires a whole-of-government response. \\n \\nEffective governance also requires far-sighted thinking, with due consideration of the \\nimperatives of a just transition. Existing processes are mostly weighted toward short-\\nrun and immediate effects on workers and businesses. These processes often do not \\npay sufficient attention to the long-run economic and environmental damage done \\nby high emissions and out-dated technologies. It follows that any decision with a \\nsubstantial long-range economic impact, especially around energy, infrastructure, \\nand new economic activities, must consider the implications for the just transition. \\n \\n  '),\n",

Close collaboration between government departments will be \\ncrucial to establish policies and programmes that can adapt to changes in the fiscal \\nlandscape and support the development of skills and employment opportunities. \\nThe nature of scale of the transition requires cooperative governance arrangements \\nin line with the principles articulated in the Intergovernmental Relations Framework \\nAct (Act 13 of 2005) and the Draft Climate Change Act (DFFE 2022). \\n \\nOther specific roles of national government in supporting a just transition include:  \\n• Providing overall policy and planning coherence in support of a just transition, \\nwith clear execution timelines and targets \\n• Allocating responsibilities, explicitly and consistently, to government agencies for \\nimplementing strategies and activities to support a just transition (these \\nresponsibilities must be allocated taking cognisance of the complementary roles \\nof other economic actors i.e., provincial governments and districts, municipal \\ngovernments, private businesses, and labour organisations) \\n• Mobilising resources, from both the public and private sectors, particularly \\nconsidering South Africa’s extraordinary spatial inequalities \\n• Integrating the just transition imperative into the national budget and public \\nspending \\n• Supporting capacity building at the provincial and municipal levels for effective \\nimplementation of the just transition agenda, including remedying the harms \\nfrom State Capture and poor governance  \\n• Supporting municipalities to develop a new revenue model for electricity sales in \\nthe transition to clean electricity system \\n• Providing financial incentives to spur a just transition  \\n• Creating forums and dispute-settlement mechanisms to ensure timely and \\nbinding decision-making around core strategies \\n• Promoting social solidarity and collective action in at-risk communities \\n• Monitoring progress toward the overall aims of the just transition, building on \\nsystems already in place (e.g., from the Department of Planning, Monitoring, and \\nEvaluation (DPME)) and ensuring that the results effect course corrections when \\nrequired \\n• Ensuring that mining companies adhere to social and labour plans in line with \\nMPRDA regulations and make adequate financial provision for end-of-life mine \\nrehabilitation in line with NEMA regulations (DFFE 2021) \\n \\n  '),\n",

Sub-National Government \\n \\nProvincial and local governments have crucially important roles to play in \\nresponding to spatially specific climate transition impacts and coordinating just \\ntransition measures in their provinces and municipal areas. At the same time many \\nof them have limited means and, in some cases, struggle to deliver basic services. \\nThese spheres of government will therefore require support to improve capacity, \\nboth in terms of financial resources and technical expertise, to give effect to a just \\ntransition while improving resilience to the impacts of climate change. It is also vital \\nthat subnational governments' mandate is clearly defined, owned, and resourced, \\nas overlapping mandates threaten to weaken ownership. \\n \\nSpecific roles of provincial and local governments in supporting a just transition \\ninclude:  \\n• Identifying climate impacts, just transition impacts, and vulnerabilities in the \\nprovince or municipality, along with community needs and adaptation \\nrequirements, and integrating these into Provincial Growth and Development \\nStrategies and Integrated Development Plans, as well as local climate action \\nplans \\n• Implementing and managing adaptation projects to improve community \\nresilience, including disaster risk management strategies and early warning \\nsystems \\n• Providing essential infrastructure services, including service delivery, which \\nrequires extensive efforts to improve capacities, to improve the efficiency of \\npublic spending, and to improve the operations and maintenance of these \\nservices \\n• Regulating planning and land management, in a manner that supports the \\noverall aims of a just transition \\n• Supporting local economic diversification, with a particular focus on working \\npeople and small businesses in at-risk communities, recognising that different \\napproaches will be required in different provinces, based on economic activity \\n• Empowering individuals, communities, ward committees, municipalities, unions, \\nand civil society organisations to engage in discussions around the transitions that \\nlie ahead (including the creation of new economic clusters), and incorporating \\ntheir inputs into decisions \\n• Facilitating collaborations and partnerships with social partners including \\ntraditional leaders, in support of a just transition \\n \\n6.3. Other Social Partners \\n \\nOther social partners will need to play their part in the just transition—embracing the \\nvision, principles, and key policy interventions set out in this framework. To do this, \\nsocial partners must be equipped with the capacity and power to manage—and \\neven benefit from—the impacts of the climate transition. In this instance, “capacity is \\nnot the ability to implement someone else’s agenda, but the ability to set and \\npursue your own agenda and, in that sense, it should be a core element of any \"),\n",

This principle embodies the spirit of a just \\ntransition in South Africa.  \\n \\nSpecifically, labour unions must continue the fight for decent work and protecting \\njobs in support of a just transition. Civil society must continue to champion the social \\nand environmental agenda and hold stakeholders to account for the promises they \\nmake. Research institutions and academia must continue to deepen thinking \\naround the opportunities and risks associated with the just transition and make \\nevidence-based recommendations that inform planning for the climate transition. \\nThe youth must continue to champion a sustainable future for all. Business must drive \\nthe innovation and investment in clean technologies that create and/or sustain \\nemployment, at the same time as shouldering their responsibilities for environmental, \\nsocial and governance issues.  \\n \\nBusiness should pursue long-term value creation by considering the needs of all their \\nstakeholders, and society at large, in line with the principles of stakeholder \\ncapitalism (Schwab & Vanham 2021). Further roles of business in supporting a just \\ntransition include:  \\n• Using corporate social investment to stimulate local enterprises and support skills \\ndevelopment, pursuing the principles of Broad-Based Black Economic \\nEmpowerment including women’s empowerment  \\n• Incorporating climate risks and opportunities into business strategies and \\ndecisions  \\n• Employing recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial \\nDisclosures (TCFD), especially in relation to disclosing climate change impacts in \\nfinancial statements and using scenarios to understand future impacts \\n• Embedding environment, social, and governance (ESG) principles across all \\noperations; ensuring a board member has overall responsibility for ESG and \\nclimate change (and that the board receives regular ESG and climate change \\ntraining and at induction); appointing non-executive directors with strong \\nESG/sustainability/climate change experience and qualifications; implementing \\nexecutive-level incentives for ESG and climate performance) \\n• Setting Science Based Emissions Reduction Targets, where possible and \\nconsidering equity and fair share approaches  \\n• Tracking environmental, social, governance and climate impacts, and disclosing \\nthese impacts through best-practice reporting, including through the CDP and \\nJohannesburg Stock Exchange \\n• Establishing just transition offices in large corporations, when applicable to \\nbusiness operations \\n• For mining companies in particular, implement social and labour plans in line with \\nRegulation 46 of the Mineral And Petroleum Resources Development Act (Act 28 \\nof 2002), and make adequate financial provision for end-of-life mine \\nrehabilitation in line with NEMA regulations (DFFE 2021). \\n \\n  '),\n",

Collective Action \\n \\nA just transition will benefit through collective action by all social partners, requiring a \\nshared commitment towards: \\n• Engaging under the principles of transparency, openness, impartiality and \\nconsensus, effectiveness and relevance, and coherence  \\n• Finding ways to better integrate the children, the youth, and women into \\npolicymaking for the just transition at national, provincial, and local levels (e.g., \\nprovision of childcare, travel support, multiple languages)  \\n• Developing just transition plans through a spatial lens, considering different just \\ntransition approaches in different regions (e.g., Mpumalanga will need a new \\nregional development plan beyond coal; the disparities in the rural areas and \\ncoastal regions of South Africa make certain communities more vulnerable than \\nothers, etc.) \\n \\n7. Finance for a Just Transition \\n \\nAchieving a just transition in South Africa will require significant capital mobilisation, \\nfrom both public and private sources, both domestically and internationally. It is \\nestimated that South Africa will require at least US$250 billion over the next three \\ndecades to transform the energy system, excluding the additional requirements to \\ntransition to a fully green economy (Blended Finance Taskforce & Centre for \\nSustainability Transitions 2022). \\n \\nDomestically, capital can be mobilised by strengthening regulation and institutional \\narrangements, partnerships between the public and private sector for delivery, and \\nattracting capital into new markets, technologies, business models, and enterprises \\n(including small- and medium-sized enterprises). Historically, around three-quarters of \\nSouth Africa’s climate finance flows (public and private) have been allocated to \\nclean energy generation projects, which has largely been a function of the \\ncommercial maturity of the renewable energy sector, spearheaded by the \\nRenewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme. \\nNational Treasury has a key leading role to play in incorporating climate \\nconsiderations and the just transition imperative into national financing and \\nbudgeting, to ensure alignment with national objectives. National Treasury has \\nalready created working groups focused on climate change and the just transition, \\nas well as deepened work on financing a sustainable economy, among other \\nactivities (National Treasury 2021; National Treasury 2022). \\n \\nInternationally, capital can be mobilised through the provisions of the Paris \\nAgreement, among others, where developed countries are required to provide \\nsupport to developing countries in reaching their climate goals. Support includes \\nfinance, capacity building, and technology transfer. The US$ 8.5 billion Just Energy \\nTransition Partnership, currently being defined, between South Africa and the \\nEuropean Union, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States in \\nNovember 2021 is illustrative of the type of financing arrangement that is possible in \\nsupport of a just transition (The Presidency 2021).

Indeed, a successful \\ntransition requires collective action, pulling toward a shared vision, with a high \\ndegree of trust between all parties (PCC 2022b). The urgency and scale of the task \\nat hand necessitates a sincere commitment by all stakeholders. The President has \\nfrequently spoken of the need for a social compact to build South Africa’s \\neconomy, address poverty and inequality and heal our divided society. Various \\nengagements with business, labour and other social partners have taken place and \\nare ongoing in this regard. The major economic, social and environmental decisions \\nrequired for a just transition similarly require social partners to forge a consensus \\naround the climate transition. The just energy transition, in particular, needs partners \\nto agree around the pace of decarbonization, the scaling up of low carbon energy \\nand the value chains that support it, the upgrading of the energy grid and the \\nmobilization of climate finance, at scale, to enable a just transition. Further work, in \\nconsultation with all social partners, is required to develop a detailed just transition \\nimplementation plan, with this document as the guiding frame. The PCC will \\ncontinue to support a social compact around the just transition, undertaking \\nevidence-based research and bringing together all stakeholders to define future \\ndevelopment pathways, considering the risks and opportunities posed by a \\nchanging climate.  \\n  '),\n",

\\nneeds creates vulnerability to oil price volatility and results in high energy \\ncosts, which place a burden on local development. As a collection of  \\nlow-lying, isolated islands, Kiribati is particularly vulnerable to rising sea \\nlevels, increasing storm strength, disruptions to rainfall that supplies fresh \\nwater, and other dangers of climate change. To address these challenges \\nand support economic and social development, the Government of \\nKiribati is dedicated to finding energy solutions and climate change \\nmitigation measures that are sustainable, reliable and affordable.  \\nThe Kiribati 2009 National Energy Policy calls for access to sustainable, reliable and affordable energy \\nservices. In 2011, Kiribati joined Pacific Island leaders to agree on developing credible, comprehensive \\nenergy roadmaps that improve energy security, reduce dependency on fossil fuel and increase access \\nto electricity. In 2012, Kiribati worked with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) \\nto conduct a Renewables Readiness Assessment (RRA) and has adopted the renewable energy \\ntargets defined in the RRA. In September 2014, Kiribati joined the IRENA Lighthouses Initiative and \\ncompleted a Quickscan, which provided a comprehensive assessment of the enabling conditions for \\nthe accelerated deployment of renewables and identified specific needs for targeted support from \\ndevelopment partners. \\nThe 2012-2015 Strategic Plan for Kiribati’s infastructure and sustainable energy development, together \\nwith the Quickscan, highlighted the need for a long-term roadmap covering the energy sector.  In \\nresponse to these calls for action, Kiribati has co-operated with IRENA, the Pacific Community (SPC) \\nand the Pacific Power Association (PPA) to develop the Kiribati Integrated Energy Roadmap (KIER).  \\nThe KIER comprises a policy framework, with specific targets, and a prioritised action plan, including \\ncost estimates and timelines. The KIER covers institutional, policy, regulatory, technical, financial and \\ncapacity-building actions. Collectively, these will enable the Government of Kiribati to achieve its \\nvision of an energy sector that contributes to energy independence and sustainable development. \\nThe KIER also demonstrates Kiribati’s commitment to deploying renewable energy and addressing \\nthe challenges of climate change. \\nKiribati has already taken action to put in place the recommendations of the KIER, and I am confident \\nthat the dedicated efforts of the government and people of Kiribati, and the co-ordinated support \\nof the international development community, will let us realise of our dream of becoming an energy-\\nindependent nation.\\nHonourable Ruateki Tekaiara\\nMinister for Infrastructure and Sustainable Energy\\nRepublic of Kiribati\\n'),\n",

This information is directed towards to the Government of Kiribati, private \\nsector, State-Owned Enterprises, Non-Governmental Organisations in Kiribati, and international partners for development \\nand finance. This NDC Investment Plan includes the national level background information on the presented mitigation \\nopportunities, which is based on information gained from published documentation and through consultations with key \\nnational sectoral stakeholders. \\nThe process of stakeholder engagement during the development of this NDC Investment Plan included an initial workshop \\nand parallel one-on-one meetings with key national stakeholders in the transport, energy efficiency, and finance sectors. \\nThis initial workshop and one-on-one meetings identified the potential mitigation opportunities in the sectors, information \\navailability, and the use of existing financial instruments and sources of financing in Kiribati. Initial results of this NDC \\nInvestment Plan were presented through a workshop with applicable stakeholders in Kiribati consisting of a broad \\nrepresentation of government entities, education institutions, financial institutions, private sector, NGO, State-Owned \\nEnterprises, and development partners. The outcomes of the initial results and the valued feedback from the consultation \\nwere used to strengthen information regarding the 24 identified mitigation opportunities and narrowed these down to 15 \\n“primary mitigation opportunities”. The NDC Investment Plan was then validated through a final consultation meeting \\nattended by key national stakeholders in the transport and energy efficiency sectors. \\nIt is noted that from the context of reducing GHG emissions , the primary mitigation opportunities defined in this NDC \\nInvestment Plan fall within both the existing boundary of the unconditional and conditional mitigation targets of Kiribati’s \\n(Intended) NDC issued in 2016. The mitigation opportunities also address the Kiribati 20-Year Vision 2016-2036. In this \\ncontext this NDC Investment Plan, along with the NDC Roadmap, can be used as tools to enhance the transparency of the \\nphysical implementation and financial pathways of how Kiribati can reach its NDC targets with support gained through the \\nmeans of implementation (e.g. capacity building, technology transfer, and finance). \\nKiribati’s (Intended) NDC issued in 2016 estimates the energy sector Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario emissions will \\nreach 78,300 tCO2e in 2030. The (Intended) NDC has an unconditional commitment to reduce GHG emissions from this \\nBAU scenario by approximately 13% in 2030 (10,090 tCO 2e), and a conditional commitment to reduce a further 49% \\n(38,420 tCO2e). This is a combined commitment to reduce 62% of GHG emissions from the energy sector BAU scenario, \\nwhich is an estimated total mitigation of 48,510 tCO2e in 2030.2 \\nThe 15 primary mitigation opportunities presented in this NDC Investment Plan consist of 9 opportunities in the transport \\nsector, and 6 opportunities in the energy efficiency sector to be implemented from 2020 to the end of 2030. Information \\nis also provided for 9 secondary mitigation opportunities. The consolidated temporal financing pathway of the primary \\nmitigation opportunities in both transport and energy efficiency lead to an estimated need for US$ 210.5M in total investment \\nin the sectors. This includes US$ 15.5M in capacity building and technical assistance needs, and US$ 195M in capital \\ninvestments.3\\n2  Kiribati’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, Republic of Kiribati, 2016\\n3  Does not include all capital investments due to the limited availability of information needed to quantify activity, and the investment costs for  \\n  some of the mitigation opportunities.'),\n",

These primary mitigation opportunities have \\nthe potential to reduce 115,400 tCO2 in the 2020 through 2030 period, and to reach a mitigation potential of 18,200 \\ntCO2/yr in 2030. This is a potential mitigation of 23% of the estimated BAU baseline in 2030 as defined in the (Intended) \\nNDC from 2016 .4 This leads to a combined potential mitigation cost of 1,400 US$/tCO 2.

These primary mitigation opportunities \\nhave the potential to reduce 62,500 tCO2 in the 2020 through 2030 period, and to reach a mitigation potential of 14,900 \\ntCO2/yr in 2030. This is a potential mitigation of 19% of the estimated BAU baseline in 2030 as defined in the (Intended) \\nNDC from 2016.5 This leads to a combined potential mitigation cost of 760 US$/tCO 2 for the primary opportunities during \\nthe period of 2020 through 2030.

The private sector (households and businesses) has experience with \\nsmall levels of use of equity and retail & commercial lending, and the public sector (Government of Kiribati entities) has \\nreliable experience in the use of the state budget and grants, and in some cases limited use of other special financial \\ninstruments such as lending guarantees. The estimated US$ 210.5M in investment needed to implement the primary \\nmitigation opportunities in the NDC Investment Plan, is equivalent to 112% of Kiribati’s Real GDP in 2018,6 and 138% of \\nthe Government of Kiribati’s state budget for 2018.7 \\nDue to past financial sector activities, stakeholders in Kiribati have limited experience with the implementation of a \\nsignificate portion of the financial instruments needed to finance the primary mitigation opportunities. Existing limitations \\nare mainly due the scale of finance need for the financial instruments and complexity of this (including blended finance). \\nAdditional capacity building and technical assistance will be needed to prepare individual financial instruments for each \\nmitigation opportunity and scale them to the level needed to support significant GHG mitigation in the transport and energy \\nefficiency sectors. Financing of all primary mitigation opportunities will include grants, and a few include equity, debt, and \\nfiscal policy/regulation changes which will need to work together as blended finance to ensure the level of transition needed \\nto reach the mitigation potential highlighted for each primary mitigation opportunity in this NDC Investment Plan.

Introduction \\nThis Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Investment Plan for Kiribati is prepared as a part of the assignment \\nfor the “Preparation of an NDC Roadmap and NDC investment plans and project pipeline (in Kiribati) in the transport and \\nenergy efficiency sectors”. This activity is delivered by the Regional Pacific NDC Hub for the Government of Kiribati (GOK) \\nthrough the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). The Pacific NDC Hub is implemented through a partnership between the \\nDeutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, GGGI, Pacific Community (SPC), and Secretariat \\nof the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP). The Regional Pacific NDC Hub has financial support from the \\nGerman, United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australian Governments. \\nThis NDC Investment Plan, and included Project Pipeline, and related NDC Roadmap, have the purpose to provide essential \\ninformation on opportunities for GHG mitigation and their potential means for financing in the transport (land, maritime, and \\naviation) and energy efficiency sectors. This information is directed towards the GOK, the private sector and State-Owned \\nEnterprises (SOEs) in Kiribati, and international partners for development and finance. This NDC Investment Plan includes \\nthe national level background information on the presented mitigation opportunities (also referred to as the ‘opportunities’) \\ngained through published documentation and consultations with key national sectoral stakeholders.8 \\nContext of Kiribati and GHG Emissions\\nKiribati is an island country in the Pacific Ocean that comprises 33 atolls and reef islands, with an Exclusive Economic \\nZone (EEZ) of 3,550,000 km2. Close to 60% of Kiribati’s total population of over 110,000 people resides on South and North \\nTarawa islands, and close to 6,500 people reside on Kiritimati Island, representing the largest population centres. Where \\nthe remaining population are divided between 20 other populated islands.9 In addition, Kiribati has one of the smallest \\neconomies in the world with an estimated GDP of US$ 188m and a per capita GNI of US$ 3,140 in 2018.10\\nKiribati’s Second National Communications (SNC) on Climate Change indicated total national GHG emissions of 64,000 \\ntCO2e in 2008. The approximate GHG emissions of 63,000 tCO 2e in 2014 reported in Kiribati’s (Intended) NDC issued in \\n2016 represents approximately 0.0002% of global emissions. Kiribati’s (Intended) NDC issued in 2016 has an unconditional \\ncommitment to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 13% in 2030, and a conditional commitment to reduce GHG \\nemissions by 49% in 2030, based on a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario. With the BAU GHG emissions estimated to be \\n78,300 tCO2e in 2030. As shown in the Figure 1 below. This is a combined commitment to reduce roughly 62% of GHG \\nemissions by 2030 based on the BAU scenario. These commitments under Kiribati’s (Intended) NDC issued in 2016 cover \\nthe 1st (2020-2025) and 2nd (2026-2030) commitment periods under the Paris Agreement. The mitigation in GHG emissions \\nunder (Intended) NDC issued in 2106 are expected to come from the reduction in fossil fuels use in the energy sector and \\ncarbon storage in the ocean ecosystem, and lead to a projected total reduction in GHG emissions of approximately 48,500 \\ntCO2e in 2030. In this context, Kiribati’s (Intended) NDC issued in 2106 has a 2030 goal to reduce approximately 12,500 \\ntCO2 annually from transport, and approximately 13,000 tCO 2 annually from the maximum use of renewable energy and \\nenergy efficiency11, which is a total of 25,500 tCO2 annually in 2030.12 \\n8  Office of the President (OB), Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable Energy (MISE), Tax Unit - Ministry of Finance and Economic \\nDevelopment (MOFED), Office of Statistic - Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED).

There is a partial lack of accurate data or unknown level of activity (e.g. the \\npossible extent of future implementation) associated with most of mitigation opportunities. Where applicable data was not \\navailable, the mitigation potentials are estimated based on various qualified assumptions. Improving the accuracy of the \\nmitigation potentials of the opportunities will require a more robust set of underlying data, and possibly additional studies \\nwhen required data is missing, and securing this is beyond the scope of this current technical assistance activity. Noting that \\nseveral activities for improved data availability and accuracy are included in the capacity building and technical assistance \\nactivities of many of the opportunities.15 The mitigation potentials do however, provide sufficient information for Kiribati to \\nmake decisions as to which opportunities shall be prioritised, and for taking further steps to improve data availability and \\naccuracy. All mitigation potentials are rounded to the nearest hundred, and key assumptions for each mitigation opportunity \\ncan be found in the Concept Notes of the Project Pipeline. \\n14  Note that only CO2 emissions, and no other GHGs, are addressed in this NDC Investment Plan because the energy sector targets in Kiribati’s \\n(Intended) NDC only include CO2 emissions.\\n15  These include but are not limited to improving energy and transport statistics via individual studies / surveys or further inclusions in population \\n/ household census, improved categorisation of customs data, improved data on the disaggregation of fuels use, a top-down total disaggregated energy \\nbalance, transport behaviour studies…etc. '),\n",

This assessment is based on fossil fuels imported from \\n2014 and after, therefore the baseline of the assessment does not match that of the (Intended) NDC.  \\nDetermination of investment and support needs\\nThe investment and support needs (which include project & programme development, capacity building, and technical \\nassistance) costs are determined in 2019 US$ and are based on estimated costs as incurred in the Pacific region up \\nthrough 2019. These values are rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand US$ or higher. These costs are also \\ndependent on the accuracy of data and level of activities as described above, and equally can reflect a similar potential \\nlevel of error. In addition, the impact of external factors, such as but not limited to the global economic downturn caused \\nby the COVID-19 pandemic, recent energy and commodity price swings, means that the cost estimates should be seen as \\nindicative.16 More accurate costs will need to be determined during the development and technical assistance activities of \\neach individual mitigation opportunity chosen for implementation. \\n1.3.2 Alignment of the NDC Investment Plan to national policies / strategies / plans\\nThe GOK has extensively integrated climate change across national level policies, strategies, and plans, as well as \\nintegration into the planning of several sectors. This NDC Investment Plan is aligned with nine primary policies, strategies, \\nand plans divided into the following three categories shown in the figure below: Multi-Sector National, Multi-Sector Climate \\nChange, and Energy & Transport Sectors.17 Further analysis of the alignment of this NDC Investment Plan with the primary \\npolicies, strategies, and plans can be found in Annex B. \\nRegional Pacific NDC Hub\\nTechnical Assistance\\n(Transport and Energy Efficiency)\\nNDC Roadmap\\nKiribati 20 Year Vision 2016-2036\\nKiribati Development Plan 2016-2019\\nKiribati Integrated Environmental Policy\\nKiribati Climate Change Policy\\nKiribati’s 1st NDC (and future 2nd NDC)\\nMinistry Strategic Plan 2020-2030 for MICTTD & SOEs\\nKiribati Integrated Energy Roadmap 2017-2025\\nSREP in Low Income Countries: Investment Plan\\nfor the Republic of Kiribati\\nEnergy & Transport\\nSectors Planning\\nMulti-Sector Climate\\nStrategy and Planning\\nMulti-Sector National\\nStrategy and Planning\\nKiribati Joint Implementation Plan: for climate change\\nand disaster risk management 2019-2028\\nNDC Investment Plan\\nAlignment\\nProject Pipeline\\nFigure 4: NDC Investment Plan alignment with national strategy and planning\\n16  The cost of financing is not included in the estimated investment and support needs.

This reality \\nof common challenges has significant potential to be addressed in the PICs through multi-country efforts to increase \\neffectiveness and efficiency, guided by a country driven process. Currently there are dozens of development partners \\noperating in the PICs who are often competing for funds, and are applying their efforts through individual projects and \\nprogrammes, sometimes with conflicting priorities or approaches. In addition, there is also a proliferation of “Centres” \\nperforming duplicate and overlapping support tasks to PICs for climate change and social & economic development. To \\noptimise PICs wide efforts in climate change, including for NDC implementation and finance, multi-country efforts specific to \\ncertain sectors should be emphasised via single coordinating entities, to optimise shared resources, ensure a coordinated \\nand collective effort, and capitalise on economies of scale. It is important to note that the Government of Kiribati, and the \\ngovernments of other PICs, do not currently have the capacity to finance, host, and coordinate Multi-Country Efforts. \\nAn example of a Multi-Country Effort via a single coordinating entity for the Maritime Transport sector is the Pacific \\nBlue Shipping Partnership (PBSP) 18 which is a PICs driven framework to allow PICs to access blended finance and \\ncapacity building & technical assistance at a large-scale. The PBSP has the purpose to catalyse a multi-country transition \\nto sustainable, resilient, and low carbon maritime transport in the Pacific region. The Prime Minister of Fiji announced \\nthe establishment of the PBSP by the governments of Fiji and the Marshall Islands in 2019, which will be coordinated \\nin partnership with Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and others.19 The PBSP has the goal \\nto accelerate the development of a 100% carbon-free maritime transport sector by 2050, including a 40% reduction of \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping by 2030. In 2020 the PBSP is in initial stages of preparation and is being \\ncoordinated by its member states to reduce the regional cost of the low-carbon transition of the Pacific maritime sector by \\nincreasing the level of regional coordination and by ensuring effective and efficient delivery to member states.20 The PBSP \\nwill also allow for greater regional resilience to disasters and emergencies by improving the regional capacity to mobilise \\nresources and by facilitating the growth of regional commerce.\\nAnother example of a Multi-Country Effort via a single coordinating entity for the Energy Efficiency sector is the Pacific \\nCentre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (PCREEE) 21 which supports the PICs with capacity building & \\ntechnical assistance in common renewable energy and energy efficiency efforts. The PCREEE was established in 2014 \\nin cooperation between Pacific Community (SPC), the Sustainable Energy Island and Climate Resilience Initiative (SIDS \\nDOCK), and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO). An example of PCREEE’s, and its parent \\nentity SPC’s, efforts are the multi-country project for Pacific Appliance Labelling and Standards Programme (PALS)22 \\nbetween 2012-2019, which also targeted Kiribati, and achieved mixed results. However, lessons have been learned in \\naddressing the common challenges in energy efficiency in the PICs, and these can be carried further to enhance energy \\nefficiency efforts through actions in the future.\\nLessons of Emergencies\\nKiribati does not lie within the general pathway of Pacific cyclones and does not face the same severe weather events as \\nsome PICs, but Kiribati suffers from the impact of other emergency challenges such as that of COVID-19, sea-level rise, \\nperiodic heavy rains and drought. In this context, COVID-19 has provided an opportunity to reset PICs priorities towards \\ndecarbonisation in economic sectors through green economic recovery and inter-island and multi-country reciprocity in \\ntrade. Decarbonisation in economic sectors addresses the two following current emergency challenges faced by PICs:\\n18 Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership Concept Note, https://mcst-rmiusp.org/images/Projects/PBSP2019/PBSP_Concept_\\nNote_Feb_2020.pdf \\n19  COP23 (2019), “‘We all know that a healthy and functioning ocean is the single most important factor influencing climate.’ – PM Frank \\nBainimararma’s Remarks at the High-Level Panel on a Sustainable Ocean Economy.” https://cop23.com.fj/we-all-know-that-a-healthy-\\nand-functioning-ocean-is-the-single-most-important-factor-influencing-climate/ \\n20  MCTTT (2020) “Decarbonising Domestic Shipping Industry: Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership”. https://www.mcttt.gov.fj/publications-resources/\\npress-release/decarbonising-domestic-shipping-industry-pacific-blue-shipping-partnership/?fbclid=IwAR1mBCPHoXyfVr5ExJqbNGe5Y9hPrtNR0LU8Q325B\\niObPO42uvsY0VY1sGo\\n21  PCREEE Website, https://www.pcreee.org/\\n22  Pacific Appliance Labelling and Standards Programme Evaluation Report, http://prdrse4all.spc.int/sites/default/files/final_pals_\\nevaluation_report.pdf '),\n",

Integration of Green Recovery and Green Jobs creation should be coupled with COVID-19 response and \\nrecovery to enhance the implementation of sectoral mitigation actions and the achievement of NDC targets. This \\noffers a key opportunity in the PICs to include “Green” in their economic recovery, especially for jobs creation \\nand related vocational and professional training needed for supporting the transition to a decarbonised economy. \\nThe focus of recovery efforts can, in many cases, integrate or even focus on mitigation actions, which also helps \\nincrease resilience to climate change as well as reduce the economic burden and dependency on imported fossil \\nfuels and future demand for power generation.\\n2. COVID-19 has led to restrictions on the availability and movements of goods (including food) in the Pacific, \\nan impact which some PICs such as Kiribati are feeling more than others. Critical thinking has identified that culture \\nand community are core strengths of Pacific Islanders and have been fundamental to their resilience in the past. 23 \\nInter-island and multi-country reciprocity in times of disaster response and enhancement of trade will in general \\nprovide solutions that strengthen regional and national resilience from global shocks. This critical thinking stresses \\nthe need for transformative actions to be based on sound science and cultural and community strengths which \\nplace environmental sustainability and resilience above pure economic development. \\n1.4 Using the NDC Investment Plan and Project Pipeline\\nThis NDC Investment Plan and its annexes are meant to support each other in terms of communicating to stakeholders \\ncertain information regarding the sector, sub-sector, and detailed information for individual mitigation opportunities in Kiribati. \\nThe NDC Investment Plan offers the mitigation context and consolidated information for each sector and sub-sector and \\na summary of the opportunities and their investment needs. It also presents a financing pathway and macro-level needs \\nfor financial instruments and sources of finance. The annexes offer more detail into each of the aspects presented in the \\nbody of the NDC Investment Plan, and the Project Pipeline (Concept Notes) provides further pertinent information for each \\nmitigation opportunity identified in the NDC Investment Plan, including needs for financing, support, and implementation. \\nFigure 5 presents what information is found within the NDC Investment Plan and the annexes.\\n23   See for example “#17 Miniseries on COVID-19 and Inequality: Responses from the Pacific Ocean”, Global Research Programme on Inequality \\n(GRIP) . https://gripinequality.org/2020/05/17-miniseries-on-covid-19-and-inequality-responses-from-the-pacific-ocean/ \\nPhoto credit: https://www.flickr.com/'),\n",

NDC Investment Planning for Transport (Land, Maritime, Aviation) \\nThe GOK plays a predominant role in the transport sector in Kiribati, in terms of regulation, enforcement of safety standards, \\nand through its SOEs responsible for aviation and maritime transport services (including infrastructure). The private sector \\ninvolved in the transport sector in Kiribati is small and primarily land transport focussed. There are only a handful of \\ncompanies operating only one or two ships on a limited number of domestic routes in the maritime sector for example. \\nHowever, individuals/households and island/community groups are also key stakeholders as owners and operators of \\nsmall maritime vessels and land transport vehicles. \\nKiribati does not have what most would consider as a ‘market’ economy, and this influences the makeup of the transport \\nsector with the government taking a much more dominant role in service delivery than would be normal within a market \\neconomy. Such government intervention is essential to maintain basic goods and service delivery to marginalised and \\nremote communities. Kiribati faces enormous challenges with regards to transport, especially for maritime and aviation \\nsub-sectors. These challenges include a small population scattered across a huge EEZ with limited land resources and \\nrelatively high costs associated with finance and insurance.24 Depending on the mode of transport, the balance shifts \\nwidely between public and private operations. All registered aircraft operating domestically are owned by the national air \\ncarrier, Air Kiribati. Sea transport services are provided by a number of privately owned ships, supplemented by the Kiribati \\nNational Shipping Line (KNSL), which operates a small fleet. In land transport, while there are many vehicles owned and \\noperated by the various government ministries, most land transport operations for the general public are conducted by \\nprivate operators, with no municipal or national public transit system established. \\nTo date, the driving forces behind investment in the transport sector have been economic and social development and \\nadaptation to climate change, not mitigation, so emission reduction has not been an important consideration. The GOK \\n(supported by international development partners) has already invested significantly in improving the transport sector, and \\nthis investment needs to be built upon and leveraged to maximise the benefits that could accrue from transitioning to low \\ncarbon transport. There are also opportunities for Kiribati to benefit from participating in global initiatives to raise its profile \\namongst global partnerships focused on sustainable transport.25\\nThe GOK has set the NDC conditional target to reduce approximately 12,500 tCO2e annually from transport by 2030.26 Key \\nconstraints for low or zero carbon development in the transport sector for Kiribati are similar to those faced by the region \\nand are well-documented.27 These include barriers associated national policy, financing, data availability and reliability, lack \\nof a supporting regional policy landscape, and lack of awareness of available options for a low carbon transition. \\nThe above situation is changing however, due in large part to the efforts of a few Pacific organisations28 collaborating since \\n2012, to raise awareness and political prioritisation of the transition of the transport (particularly maritime) sector away \\nfrom fossil fuels. Coupled with greater priority being given to decarbonisation of transport at an international level through \\nUNFCCC, IMO and ICAO processes. The regional policy landscape is now starting to shift focus and look at transitioning \\naway from fossil fuels. Pacific leaders are now far more aware of the need for the transport sector to transition from \\nfossil fuels, and that awareness and commitment29 will result in greater priority being given to this challenge in the future. \\nKiribati’s capacity to apply for and access a greater level of finance needs to be built in order for the country to capitalised \\non this changing priority.30 Other PICs (e.g. RMI and Fiji) have targets and plans in place to decarbonise their transport \\nsector, Kiribati can take advantage of this increased interest, data, research and action to formulate its own initiatives.31 \\n24  In particular, the Government, as all other governments and many private operators in the Pacific, self-risks their assets in the maritime sector. \\nMeaning that vessels and maritime infrastructure are uninsured and the government accepts the risk of loss or damage caused by storms, etc.\\n25  See for example Sustainable Mobility For All Global.

Climate change is \\nexacerbating the need for external financing, as repairing damage to existing transport infrastructure and assets caused \\nby natural disasters takes up more and more of the national budget, leaving little available for investment in transport \\ndecarbonisation initiatives.  \\n2.1 Land Transport Sub-Sector\\nThe land transport sub-sector in Kiribati includes both private and public vehicles. The private sector and public largely \\npurchase second-hand vehicles from Japan, while the Plant and Vehicle Unit (PVU) and other ministries departments \\nprocure, operate, and maintain GOK vehicles, which are typically purchased new from Japan or South Korea. \\nThe Kiribati Highway Authority (KHA) accounts for 7,114 vehicles listed by manufacturer in Tarawa. Based on customs \\ndata from 2015 to 2019 and expected vehicle lifetimes for the different modes of transport there are an estimated 30,400 \\nmotorised and non-motorised vehicles active throughout Kiribati. Of these 58% are bicycles, 30% motorbikes, 9% cars, \\n2% trucks, and 1% minibuses.32 \\nThe Kiribati Insurance Company (KIC) is the sole body through which motor vehicle insurance is provided.33 There is only \\none commercial bank present in the country – ANZ, which can provide vehicle finance. The fuels market is serviced by only \\nthe national fuel supplier, Kiribati Oil Co. Ltd. (KOIL), which distributes to various petrol stations around the nation. \\nVehicles carrying more than 10 passengers incur a 25% duty, motorbikes under 100cc incur 30%, goods vehicles incur \\n35%, motorbikes over 100cc incur an 80% duty, and private vehicles have a duty range from 55-75%. Special purpose \\nvehicles (e.g. ambulances, etc.) are duty free, as are bicycles. There are currently no incentives for electric vehicles. Fees \\nand charges in the registration of vehicles are paid recognizing different classes of vehicles (A through G) and capacity \\nof engine size which are listed on the Ministry of Information, Communications, Transport, and Tourism Development \\n(MICTTD) website.34 Exemptions for fees and charges are extended to government vehicles, and many of these fall under \\nthe responsibility of the PVU. \\n2.1.1 Key sector stakeholders and existing planning in Land Transport sub-sector\\nThe land transport sub-sector in Kiribati is administered under the MICTTD and Ministry of Infrastructure and Sustainable \\nEnergy (MISE).35 PVU falls under the responsibility of MISE, while MICTTD is responsible for KOIL and KHA. Current \\nlegislation governing the sector includes the Traffic Act 2017 36, KHA serves as the licensing authority under this Act. \\nRoadworthiness and penalties are both regulated by the Commissioner of the Kiribati Police Service. The Island Councils \\nare delegated the responsibility of administering fees and charges in locations beyond Tarawa. The Public Highways \\nProtection Act 201837 established the Kiribati Land Transport Authority (KLTA), under which is delegated management \\nof the land transport infrastructure. Land transport in Kiribati, beyond South Tarawa, is regulated on an island-by-island \\nbasis, which means cohesive implementation of national-level policy is complicated by the different enforcement and \\nmanagement practices employed by island councils with road users. Existing land transport planning is mainly focused on \\ninfrastructure and centred around national economic development and long-term resilience. \\nKey stakeholders and their roles are listed below, and additional information on key stakeholders and existing planning and \\nactions in Land Transport can be found in Annex C. \\n https://www.mcst-rmiusp.org/images/Projects/TLCSeaT_HEL_TechnicalAndOperationalOptionsCatalog.pdf as is the Cerulean Project \\n32  Import data provided by Kiribati Customs, and registered vehicles from KHA\\n33  Republic of Kiribati (1981), Insurance Act 1981. http://www.paclii.org/ki/legis/num_act/ia1981116/\\n34 MICTTD (2020), Fees and Charges for Vehicle (accessed August 2020). https://www.micttd.gov.ki/article/highway-authority/fees-and-\\ncharges-vehicle\\n35  MICTTD (2020), Highway Authority (accessed August 2020). https://www.micttd.gov.ki/about-us/highway-authority\\n36  Republic of Kiribati (2017), Traffic Act 2017. http://www.paclii.org/ki/legis/num_act/ta201777/\\n37  Republic of Kiribati (2018), Public Highway Protection Act. https://www.micttd.gov.ki/sites/default/files/Public%20Highway%20\\nProtection%20Act%202018.pdf'),\n",

ANZ also operates as the sole commercial \\nbank which finances land transport-related investments. Households also own vehicles and \\nsmall vessels. \\nThe Private Sector will be the driving force in public support and compliance with the various \\nland transport decarbonisation initiatives, and finance to purchase vehicles and small vessels. \\n2.1.2 Key constraints and opportunities to strengthen the enabling environment in the Land Transport sub-\\nsector\\nIn order to encourage low-carbon land transport, the market requires clear cost-competitive alternatives to the BAU \\nscenario. Currently, most motorised vehicles are second-hand purchases and largely imported from Japan. There \\nare currently no incentives in place to encourage alternatives to the existing paradigm, either in regard to the cost of \\nimportation and taxation, or the cost of registration and roadworthiness. The strengthening opportunities indicated below, \\nand explored through the different mitigation opportunities proposed, may provide a sufficient base to encourage change. \\nThe strengthening opportunities focus on information, regulation, and finance to encourage the shift from the currently \\navailable range of vehicles to modes of transportation with lower emissions as defined in the mitigation opportunities (more \\ninformation on the enabling environment can be found in Annex F). \\n '),\n",

In 1930, there were only around 88 \\nkm of bicycle infrastructure along roads. In 1933 this had increased to 342 km mainly in urban areas and was \\nassociated with only 4% of all the country’s roads. During this same period standards were developed for both \\ncycling infrastructure planning and for the design of cycling paths (and associated roads). In the past 100 years \\ncycling has become widespread in Denmark with 12,000 km of cycle routes and is a symbol of equality and \\nfreedom within the Danish population and is estimated to mitigate GHG emissions by 20,000 tCO2 per year. The \\ncity of Copenhagen has extensive planning and regulations for cycling infrastructure and in 2021 plans to increase \\nits related spending to US$ 28M (DKK 178M) from an annual average of US$ 13M (DKK 87M) over the past \\nten years. This municipal infrastructure spending focuses on establishing new neighbourhood bike-paths, super-\\nbike-routes, eco-bike-routes, bicycle parking, traffic control measures, and capacity building. This infrastructure \\nis financed through a combination of both national and municipal government funds (from taxes), where the \\nover 673,000 bicycles in the city are privately and commercially financed. These investments will increase the \\npercentage of person-trips in the city from the current value of 28%, which already exceed the 2025 target of 25%. \\nTo implement similar actions in Kiribati under T2 and T15, the new regulation and standards for bicycle lanes for \\nroads and pathways will need to be enacted. Then planning activities for new (upgraded) infrastructure and the \\nincrease of bicycles will be needed, and the financing to support these activities. \\n \\nSources: Copenhagenize.com (2012) “Danish Bicycle Infrastructure History”, Denmark.dk (2020) “A nation of cyclists”, Køben-\\nhavns Kommune (2020) “Cykelredegørelse 2021”.

The estimated capital investment costs \\nneeded to reach the mitigation potential is US$ 792.7M between 2020 and 2030, along with an estimated cost for project/\\nprogramme development, capacity building & technical assistance of US$ 29.8M. The breakdown of support and investment \\nneeds is given in the table below, followed by a short description of each mitigation option.

This opportunity \\ninvolves the inclusion of 7,000 standard bicycles and 7,000 e-bicycles imported into Kiribati and replacing 60% of \\nthe motorbikes expected to enter the market in Kiribati under BAU conditions. Ensuring bicycle use as a primary \\nsource of transport for people of all ages (reducing reliance on motor vehicle use and associated fuel consumption) \\ncan strengthen household cost savings, GHG emission reductions, and provide potential health benefits for the \\npopulation of Kiribati. This opportunity also includes capacity building for the maintenance of standard bicycles and \\ne-bicycles, and the provision of initial spare parts, as a means to encourage sustainability of this type of transport.\\n\\uf0a7 T7 – Biofuel Blends in Land and Maritime Transport: A range of sustainable fuels are in use globally, which \\ncan be suitable alternatives for vehicles in Kiribati. This opportunity involves the import and use of biofuel blends for \\ndiesel and petrol, and the construction of necessary infrastructure to enable the use of these fuels. The applicability, \\nappropriateness, and financial viability of this option is likely dependent on the scale of use of biofuel blends in other \\nPICs, such as Fiji and Samoa. Biofuel blends would need to be shipped from Singapore to fuel transfer hubs in \\nFiji or directly to Kiribati. Technology piloting in the maritime sector is ongoing, but biofuel blends in land transport, \\nespecially biodiesel and ethanol blending, are already used and mandated extensively in Brazil, Europe, North \\nAmerica and Indonesia.\\n38 These values are highly dependent on the future growth of fuels use and land transport activity.

Congestion and increases in single-\\noccupancy travel are placing a strain on the road network, which is comprised of a single two-lane road through \\nmost of South and North Tarawa while other roads are largely unpaved roads elsewhere in Kiribati. This mitigation \\nopportunity would provide technical assistance, capacity building, and investment in motorised, transit services \\n(e.g. buses), which will offer more passenger capacity per vehicle for transit between communities. This opportunity \\nincludes establishing Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to operate up to 132 buses in Kiribati and the operational \\ninfrastructure. In addition to reducing GHG emissions, this opportunity will increase mobility and equity for those \\nin society without driver’s licenses, improving options for women, youth, elderly, disabled persons, low-income \\ntravellers, and other vulnerable groups.\\n\\uf0a7 T11 – Electric Vehicle Network Development: Technical assistance and financial support for the development \\nand introduction of up to 2,800 Electric Vehicles (EV) and a network of Level-2 chargers in Kiribati. This will include \\nboth market instruments to facilitate the introduction of EV technology and the planning for the allocation of \\ninfrastructure to create a sufficient charging network across first the public, and then the private sector locations. \\nUnlike the existing paradigm, in which individuals and households primarily purchase second-hand vehicles, the \\nlack of maturity in the EV market means a robust second-hand EV market (including battery warranty / life-cycle \\nconcerns) is not readily available to replace the second-hand internal combustion engines vehicle imports. Thus, \\nnew EVs will be required until the global second-hand market matures. This option does not include the costs of \\nadditional power generation and distribution, which will be necessary to facilitate a large-scale introduction of EVs.\\n\\uf0a7 T13 – Whole-of-Lifecycle Vehicle Programme : Derelict vehicles are a common sight around Tarawa. \\nThe current preponderance of second-hand vehicles in Kiribati means that the vehicles are being imported at \\nnearer the end of their operational lifespans, and disposal is not addressed in Kiribati. It is estimated that there \\nare 10,000 derelict vehicles across the nation, as no mechanism for disassembling, consolidating, and exporting \\nscrapped vehicles currently exists (a previous scrap mechanism ended years ago). The opportunity for government \\nintervention, as well as potential private sector operators, in the collection and export of scrap materials from \\nrecovered vehicles can be addressed through technical assistance and investment to develop and establish public-\\nprivate partnerships or service contract/licensing arrangements. This would not only create economic opportunity \\n(and employment), but also address the underlying environmental problem of past and future derelict vehicles. \\nMitigation under this option is achieved via carbon sequestration gained from the planting of vegetation in areas \\nwhere there are previous derelict vehicles.\\n\\uf0a7 T15 – Land Transport Infrastructure Upgrade for Non-motorized Transport: The design and implementation \\nof enhanced land transport infrastructure will support decarbonisation based on the availability of infrastructure \\ndesigned to prioritize use of non-motorized transport (e.g. - cycling and walking). To encourage decarbonisation, \\nby reinforcing non-motorized transport through deliberate inclusion of separated green space between vehicle \\nlanes and protected infrastructure for foot and bicycle traffic along 370 km of dedicated roadways yet to undergo \\npaving/upgrading. Technical assistance and the financing of both the design and infrastructure will guide how \\ncarriageway and bridges are partitioned, and the allocation of space between motorized and non-motorized \\ntransport will encourage GHG mitigation via non-motorised transport. Mitigation under this option is achieved via \\ncarbon sequestration gained from the planting of vegetation in separation areas.\\nMitigation Example: Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in Fiji\\n \\nThe Fijian Government introduced legislation in 2016 to waive the excise fees of 32% for the import of both used \\nand new hybrid vehicles and this led to over 4,000 hybrids passenger cars being imported by the end of 2017, \\nwhich leads to an estimated minimum annual GHG mitigation of 3,400 tCO2 assuming that all hybrid imports \\nsubstituted and traditional ICE vehicle. This was a successfully fiscal policy (e.g. lower tax), where the investment \\nin the hybrid vehicles was fully private sector financed.  However, the fiscal policy appears to have led to vehicle \\nimports increasing more than planned in 2016-2017, which can potentially contribute to a net GHG emissions \\nincrease beyond the BAU baseline. Due to the large number of imports, the excise fees waiver changed in the \\nfollowing years to only apply to new hybrid vehicles.\\nFiji also waives the excise fees for new electric vehicles and their charging stations, but these fiscal policy incentives \\nhave not led to a measurable increase in electric vehicles in Fiji due to higher cost of introducing EVs and no supply \\nof second-hand EVs which can be imported.

Globally, and \\nin Kiribati, maritime transport can be considered as having two physical components: sea-based (boats/ships) and land-\\nbased infrastructure (e.g. wharves, ports, shipyards/slips, maritime suppliers and service providers, training facilities). \\nThis NDC investment plan focuses on the sea-based component.39 \\nIn terms of the domestic fleet in Kiribati, in 2019 there were 41 registered vessels (see the table below) with anecdotal \\nevidence of several hundred small boats (<15m) that were unregistered.40 \\nIn 2005 a study found that on the island of Marakei alone, 31% of the households owned canoes, and two additional \\nboats/skiffs were used for fishing in both the surrounding ocean and inner lagoon of Marakei.41At the national level, \\nhousehold survey data from 1995 recorded 565 skiffs and 3,968 canoes in the country42, and by 2015 the total number \\nof these smaller vessels (skiffs and canoes) had increased to over 4300 in total, of which 2100 are expected to be \\nmotorised.43\\nTable 4: Number of Registered Vessels by Ownership and Length (2019)\\nVessel Owner >30m <30m\\nGOK: Kiribati National Shipping Line (KNSL) x 2 and Ministry of Fisheries & Marine Resource \\nDevelopment (MFMRD) x 3\\n5 0\\nIndividuals 4 8\\nCommunity (churches, Island Councils, etc) 1 4\\nPrivate Companies 11 8\\nTOTAL 21 20\\n \\nKNSL reports that their existing fleet (two landing craft) is insufficient to meet current demand, and additional vessels are \\nrequired. To meet this demand KNSL identify the need for a new tug and barge (250-300 DWT), a small landing craft (18m), \\na small container ship (80 TEU), and a passenger/cargo ship (~50m)44. Future demand is expected to remain the same, \\ndependent on GOK support to retain populations on outer islands45.\\nThe domestic maritime regulatory environment, similar to that of aviation, is influenced strongly by what happens at the \\ninternational regulatory level. The 2018 adoption of the ‘Initial IMO Strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships’ \\ncaused a much greater focus on CO2 emissions within the global shipping industry and this is in large part due to the \\ninfluence of PICs, including Kiribati. Under the Initial IMO Strategy, the shipping industry is to reduce carbon intensity \\nthrough the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), and other efforts, from a baseline in 2008 to reduction in carbon \\nintensity by at least 40% in 2030, and 70% in 2050 to reduce total annual shipping global emissions by at least 50% \\nby 2050 and pursue efforts to phase them out on a pathway consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals46. \\n This shift at the international level will have a large impact on shipping regulations at the domestic level in \\nKiribati, in part due the requirement on the IMO to pay particular attention to SIDS and LDCs which will result \\nin the opportunity for Kiribati to apply for capacity development and pilot project funding via the IMO. The \\nIMO regulations will also have an impact on Kiribati, particularly on the Marine Division and KPA with Flag47 \\n and Port State control obligations as the new IMO regulations come into force.\\nThe SREP identifies maritime transport as comprising 2% of total national GHG emissions.

Using the data \\nrecorded for 2014 maritime transport emissions are estimated to be as high as 23% of total national GHG emissions 49.  \\nCombined “fisheries” and “sea transport” varied between 60-80% of total unleaded petrol (ULP) used and “sea transport” \\n5-10% of total diesel (ADO) used 50.  It is noted that the value of 23% of total emissions is more in line with the emissions \\ncalculations for the neighbouring Marshall Islands which has sea transport as contributing 20% of national GHG emissions51.\\nThe discrepancy between the information sources highlights a lack of data or inadequate bifurcation of fuel use within the \\ntransport sector.\\nSince the 1980s there has been very little investment in the Pacific regional maritime transport sector which focused on \\nGHG emissions reduction and implementing low-carbon technology in proportion to total sector investment. The trial \\nprojects that were done during this time included the design and building of wind powered sailing boats of various sizes \\nfor artisanal fishing focused on improving safety of vessels (including a Food and Agriculture Organisation – FAO project), \\nother projects included retrofit of Fiji government vessels (focused on saving fuels). Those trials proved that achieving 40% \\nGHG emissions reduction by 2030 is possible for certain classes vessels. Other findings from these pilots indicated that \\nthe lack of capacity in local boat builders and surveyors resulted in problems with unsafe vessels being built, and a need \\nto introduce naval architecture criteria for proper construction of vessels. The FAO project also found reducing use of fuel \\n(and so reducing costs) was the key determining factor for artisanal fishers to use sails. At a larger scale, the continued \\noperation of the SV Kwai in the Pacific which services the Line Islands proves fuel savings of approximately 60% can be \\nachieved from soft sails vessels.52 This type of transition to low-carbon technology is supported by a strong sailing culture \\nand heritage in Kiribati. \\nFinancing and Implementing Partner Example: Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership (PBSP)\\n \\nThe Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership (PBSP) is a Pacific Island Countries (PICs) driven framework which is being \\ndeveloped to allow PICs access to blended finance and capacity building at a large-scale, with the purpose to \\ncatalyse a multi-country transition to sustainable, resilient, and low carbon maritime transport in the Pacific region. \\nThe PBSP was established by the governments of Fiji and the Marshall Islands in 2019, and is being developed \\nas a coordinated partnership with Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and others. The \\nPBSP has the goal to reduce regional GHG emission from maritime transport by 40% in 2030, and reach carbon \\nneutrality by 2050, which closely reflects the national climate change goals of several PICs and exceed those of \\nthe IMO’s Initial Strategy. \\nGoverned by a Ministerial Council, the PBSP will between 2020 and 2030 work to facilitate US$ 500m of finance \\ninto the maritime sectors of the participating PICs, with a focus to address the holistic ‘whole-of-sector’ challenges \\nfaced in the Pacific. The PBSP will work with financial and implementing institutions to deliver low-carbon vessels \\nand supporting infrastructure and capacity building to the shipping needs of the partner countries, setup a Small-\\nto-Medium Scale Enterprise (SME) finance facility enabling regional private sector access to low-carbon maritime \\ntechnology, and strengthen technical research and advisory support to partner countries.\\nThe PBSP will be coordinated by its members through a Ministerial Council supported by a secretariat (building \\non the PNA model) and will reduce the regional cost of the low-carbon transition of the Pacific maritime sector by \\nincreasing the level of coordination and by ensuring effective and efficient delivery to member states as a broad \\nprogramme of transition. The PBSP will also allow for greater regional resilience to disasters and emergencies by \\nimproving the regional capacity to mobilise resources and by facilitating the growth of intra-regional commerce.  \\n2.2.1 Key sector stakeholders and existing planning in Maritime Transport sub-sector\\nThere are very limited land-based maritime transport services in Kiribati, for example slip/boat yard facilities are only able \\nto service small boats, and most larger vessels must travel to Fiji for servicing/maintenance.

In addition to this is the fact that the existing infrastructure and fleet is insufficient to meet current \\nneeds (reflecting the “build, neglect, rebuild” syndrome)56. Issues of poor maintenance, poor ship safety, and unsuitability \\nof vessels for the operating environment, linked to lack of finance and awareness/capacity, are all challenges that need to \\nbe addressed. Whilst investment in low carbon maritime transport has been virtually non-existent in the region since the \\n1980s, that situation is now changing57 with focus on the issue being driven by both international 58 and regional debates \\nand there are opportunities for Kiribati to access new finance and technologies becoming available. The key constraints \\nand opportunities below identify the additional information needed for sound public / private sector decision-making, \\nan encouraging enabling regulatory environment, and opportunities to finance the use of low-carbon technology (more \\ninformation can be found in Annex F). 59\\nTable 6: Key Constraints and opportunities in Maritime Transport\\nConstraint / Barrier Enabling Environment Strengthening opportunities\\nAccess to Financing •\\t Prepare a low carbon National Maritime Action Plan and lodge it with IMO...etc.\\n•\\t Participate in existing PICs multi-country funding initiatives (PBSP, MTCC, MCST…).\\n•\\t Develop financing mechanisms to support domestic commercial and household deployment of low/\\nzero carbon technologies. \\nInsurance /Underwriting •\\t Champion with other PICs the discussion on insurance and underwriting needs.\\n•\\t Participate in initiatives59 which look to also address insurance/underwriting e.g. PBSP. \\n56  See for example Howes, S & Dornan, M.

Together, these have the potential to reduce \\n34,100 tCO 2 emission by the end of 2030, with an annual mitigation potential of 6,200 tCO 2/yr. in 2030. This annual \\nmitigation potential is approximately equal to 8% of the projected BAU emission in 2030. The estimated capital investment \\ncosts needed to reach the mitigation potential is US$ 34.8M between 2020 and 2030, along with an estimated cost for \\nproject/programme development, capacity building & technical assistance of US$ 4.5M.\\nIt is also important to note that there are proposals for three new vessels included in this NDC Investment Plan based \\non needs identified by KNSL. Therefore, mitigation potential is based on the decision to purchase new, purpose built low \\nemissions vessels in comparison to purchase of a fossil-fuel powered conventional vessel, and not reduction in emissions \\nfrom the existing commercial fleet. The breakdown of support and investments needs is given in the table below, followed \\nby a short description of each mitigation option. More information on each mitigation option can be found in the concept \\nnotes in Annex A.\\nTable 7: Aggregated Information for Maritime Transport Mitigation Opportunities\\nOpportunities\\nIndicative \\nDevelopment, \\nCB and TA 2020-\\n2030 (US$M)*\\nIndicative \\nInvestment \\nNeeds to 2020-\\n2030 (US$M)\\nCost of \\nMitigation\\nUS$/ tCO2\\nAnnual \\nMitigation \\n2030 (tCO2/yr.)\\nTotal \\nMitigation \\n2020-2030\\n(tCO2/yr.)\\nT1 – Outboard Motor Transition 0.8 20.8 1,100 3,600 19,900\\nT4 – National Action Plan for \\nDecarbonising Maritime Transport* 0.3 NA NA NA NA\\nT5 – Low Carbon Mini-Container Ship 1.0 5.0 700 1,400 8,400\\nT6 - Small low carbon cargo/passenger \\nfreighter 1.0 2.0 1,100 400 2,700\\nT9 – Zero Impact Cruise Liner 1.4 7.0 2,700 800 3,100\\nTotal Mitigation Potential of all 4.5 34.8 6,200 34,100\\n* Sectoral policy and planning action do not lead to direct mitigation'),\n",

The opportunity would include \\na capacity building and training programme for maintenance and operation of the alternative outboard motors for \\nboat operators and mechanics. 4-stroke outboards are considerably more energy efficient than 2-stroke motors, \\nwhich are likely the single largest source of GHG emissions for the Kiribati domestic maritime sector. Electric \\noutboards (assuming that recharging is from renewable sources) require no fossil fuels. This opportunity would \\nresult in reduced GHG emissions by reducing fossil fuel consumption in the maritime sector.\\n\\uf0a7 T4 – National Action Plan for Decarbonising Maritime Transport: This opportunity calls for the provision \\nof technical assistance for the preparation and implementation of a coordinated national level action plan for \\ndecarbonising maritime transport, including for lodging with the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).60 The \\nplan would address means to encourage decarbonisation of international ships visiting Kiribati’s ports, ships flagged \\nto Kiribati, and all other domestic vessels. It will include a set of policies, and incentives, and proposed investments \\nto support the transition to zero-carbon domestic shipping (the other mitigation opportunities proposed will form a \\npart of this this national action plan). Implementation of this plan, once developed and approved, would support \\nand guide investment towards low-carbon options rather than BAU, which would reduce GHG emissions by 40% by \\n2030 and 100% by 205061 from the maritime transport sector.\\n\\uf0a7 T5 – Low Carbon Mini-Container Ship: This opportunity includes investment in a mini container ship of 80 \\ntwenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) capacity to be operated by KNSL. Because maintaining essential sea connectivity \\nis a core priority of the GOK, this vessel would be government owned and operated. The vessel design would \\nincorporate space for limited domestic passenger transport between the three island groups. Depending on an \\noptions assessment and feasibility, the vessel would be either a low carbon new-build (preferred) or a second-hand \\nvessel retrofitted with a range of emissions abatement measures. Under the new build scenario GHG emissions \\nwould be minimised through advanced hull and propeller design; wind-hybrid main propulsion, solar/wind/biofuel \\nauxiliaries, low energy berths and maximised operational efficiencies. \\n\\uf0a7 T6 – Small Low Carbon Cargo/Passenger Freighter: This opportunity includes investment in a freighter of \\napproximately 200 tonnes, with some passenger capacity, to be operated by KNSL. This would serve as a general \\nservice vessel primarily to smaller atolls to maintain basic supply routes outgoing and copra/primary produce coming \\ninward. The vessel would be similar to the low carbon freighter being designed under the Cerulean Project but with \\nadditional allowance for some domestic passenger capacity. A low-tech, low carbon, low-cost approach to design \\nwould be undertaken. Assuming a new build is purchased, GHG emissions will be minimised through advanced \\nhull and propeller design; wind-hybrid main propulsion, solar/wind/biofuel auxiliaries, low energy hotel services and \\nmaximised operational efficiencies. \\n\\uf0a7 T9 – Zero-impact cruise liner, Phoenix Islands: This opportunity involved the implementation of a pilot ‘zero \\nimpact’ small scale cruise liner with capacity of 40-50 passengers operating from Tarawa to the Phoenix Islands \\nProtected Area (PIPA), the largest designated Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the world.62 The vessel, would be a \\ntrue blue-water vessel capable of self-sufficiency throughout routes of up to 2,500 NM with near-zero impact on the \\nmaritime or terrestrial environment, and with a zero carbon operating footprint. The design may include wind/electric \\nhybrid propulsion, RE (biofuel/solar/wind) for auxiliary hotel load63, advanced hull design and battery support. The \\ncruise liner would support GOK objective to develop PIPA as the core component of a niche, zero-impact tourism \\nindustry, which can generate employment opportunities and foreign currency for the country. As a zero-carbon \\ninvestment, the opportunity would result in zero GHG emissions.\\n60  The Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of IMO held in November 2019 agreed a draft resolution supporting IMO Member \\nStates to prepare National Action Plans to complement the IMO Initial Strategy for reduction of GHG emissions from international shipping, and for such \\nplans to be submitted to IMO to enable collaboration and sharing of information (see IMO: National Action Plans and Strategies (accessed 2020) http://\\nwww.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/PollutionPrevention/AirPollution/Pages/RELEVANT-NATIONAL-ACTION-PLANS-AND-STRATEGIES.aspx)\\n61  Kiribati NDC does not include a specific target for decarbonisation of the maritime transport sector.

The cost savings resulting contribute significantly to the continued operation of the vessel \\nwithout subsidy. The Kwai uses a crew voyage profit incentive to maximize use of the sails so reducing fuel use. \\nCrewed mainly by Kiribati seafarers, the Kwai provides a well-known example familiar to many. Given the niche \\nand unique operating scenario of the Kwai, whilst the retrofit of sails on other vessels is replicable, the financing \\nneeded to support similar pipeline project would likely need to be sourced from a mix of grants and loans \\ndepending on the target vessel owner.\\nOther examples of soft sail retrofit include the 1980’s trials in Fiji on the Mataisau and Cagidonu, GSS vessels, \\nwhich showed fuel savings of 23% overall and up to 37% if all sails were used, on domestic routes under the \\nADB funded US$40,000 project monitored by Southampton University. (Satchwell, 1985,Wind ship technology in \\nProceedings of the international symposium on wind ship technology (Windtech ’85) Southamption, and Clayton, \\n1987, Wind-Assisted Ship Propulsion Physics in Technology 18 53, UK).\\nFor Kiribati to encourage a similar vessel operating on domestic waters, a full concept note/proposal application \\nfor development will be needed, followed by Vessel design options review, feasibility studies, route planning, \\nvessel build plans, and vessel construction.\\n2.3 Aviation Transport Sub-Sector\\nKiribati currently maintains 19 domestic airports/airfields under Airports Kiribati, with Kiritimati and Bonriki Airports \\nclassified as International Airports. There are currently fewer than seven aircraft registered with Civil Aviation Authority of \\nKiribati (CAAK) to operate in Kiribati, all operated by Air Kiribati. In the context of targeting emission reductions, domestic \\naviation has not been incorporated into the existing strategic planning and policy documents. Noting that under the SREP \\nInvestment plan, it is estimated domestic aviation accounts for only 4% of national emissions. KOIL is the sole provider \\nof aviation fuel for Air Kiribati and international carriers in Kiribati. There are currently no guidelines or policies in Kiribati \\nprohibiting or incentivizing the inclusion of more efficient aircraft or the use of biofuel inputs to supplement conventional \\njet fuels. \\nIn order to achieve emission reductions while simultaneously improving air transport services, operational and infrastructural \\nactivities must improve efficiency, increase passenger density (per km of aircraft travelled), and reduce energy demands \\nwithin the airport facilities. Technological solutions enabling biofuel blends are slowly becoming commercially available \\nand operational internationally, but zero-emission aircraft (hybrid-electric and fully electric aircraft) are not expected to be \\naccessible to globally until the 2025-2035 period. \\n2.3.1 Key sector stakeholders and existing planning in Aviation Transport sub-sector\\nThe regulation of aviation activities and infrastructure in Kiribati fall under the mandate of CAAK, which reports to the \\nMICTTD as its line ministry. Under the CAAK, Air Kiribati and Airports Kiribati handle airline and airport/airfield operations, \\nrespectively. MOFED also has bearing on the industry, as financing for new aircraft is all conducted as a State exercise, \\nand as such is considered within the national budgeting process.

There are currently no private sector aircraft operating independently of the \\nstate-owned airline, which constrains the market and leaves the maritime sector to meet the needs of lower-cost travel \\ndomestically. \\nBoth aviation-related infrastructure and the aircraft themselves require significant capital investment, as well as higher \\noperational and maintenance costs per weight and volume transported than other modes. The service schedule for domestic \\naviation is also subject to a variety of market and external factors which impact efficiency, depending on occupancy, cargo \\nloading, environmental conditions, and operational performance of both the flight and ground crew, as well as the aircraft \\nthemselves. \\nTo improve GHG emissions there is a need to accommodate larger aircraft on outer island airstrips in line with the planning \\ntargets to ensure all 19 domestic airports can handle Dash-8 planes by 2023. Additionally, hybrid/electric and electric \\naircraft, as well as a biofuel supply of sufficient quality at a competitive cost, are not yet widely available in the commercial \\naviation market. In addition, training and capacity development of both aviation professionals and regulators will be needed \\nto ameliorate the existing human resource gaps across the industry. '),\n",

The Kiribati Aviation Investment \\nProject, which recently upgraded the runways of the Bonriki and Cassidy international airports, has illustrated the value of \\naviation infrastructure in allowing larger aircraft to land, which has associated benefits in reducing fuel consumption on a \\nper passenger basis. Size and quality of airport runways is a recognized constraint for the additional 19 domestic airfields \\nin operation. The need to rapidly improve these facilities is also tied to the investment in re-fleeting for Air Kiribati’s domestic \\noperations, as decisions around replacement aircraft will be made based in part upon which airports those aircraft will be \\nable to provide with regular service. This will extend beyond the runway length and corresponding allowance of larger \\naircraft sizes to include considerations around the capacity and source of electricity generation which may be needed for \\nelectrically powered aircraft. \\nThe key constraints and opportunities identified below provide the additional information for sound public / private sector \\ndecision-making, an encouraging enabling regulatory environment, and opportunities to finance the use of low-carbon \\ntechnology (more information can be found in Annex F). \\nTable 9: Key Constraints and opportunities in Aviation Transport\\nConstraint / Barrier Enabling Environment Strengthening opportunities\\nTechnology Transfer •\\t Accessing and use of biofuel blends in aviation.\\n•\\t Accessing future proven hybrid/electric and electric aircraft.\\n•\\t Trade facilitation with bilateral diplomatic/donor partners\\nFinancing •\\t Enhance bilateral and multi-lateral cooperation to secure greater availability of finance.\\n•\\t Possible inclusion of results-based-finance for carbon trading / offsets under CORSIA.\\nHuman capacity •\\t Technical assistance and training of both Air Kiribati and Airports Kiribati personnel.\\n•\\t Enhance ground operational requirements and safety protocols for aircraft handling. \\nInsufficient Infrastructure •\\t Expanding outer island airport facilities to be able to accommodate larger aircraft. \\n•\\t Enhance fuel storage and loading facilities to allow for use of biofuel blends.\\n•\\t Improving the construction quality of the airstrips to prevent closure and delays.\\n2.3.3 Mitigation opportunities and investment needs in Aviation Transport sub-sector\\nThere are four mitigation opportunities which focus on Aviation Transport.

This annual \\nmitigation potential is approximately equal to 4% of the projected BAU emissions in 2030. The estimated capital investment \\ncosts needed to reach the mitigation potential is US$ 238.8M between 2020 and 2030, along with an estimated cost for \\nproject/programme development, capacity building & technical assistance of US$ 10.1M.

This will not necessarily necessitate any specific changes in technology: \\nit can be behavioural change and integration of best practices to realise the energy efficiency gains made \\nthrough better us of technology centric measures. Introduction and training on use of emerging technology \\nwill be included when available in the market.\\n\\uf0a7 T10 – Aircraft Re-Fleeting Programme : The process of renewing the Air Kiribati (domestic) fleet of six \\nsmall aircraft provides a suitable opportunity for continual improvements in aircraft performance. The means \\nalso mainstreaming low-emissions technology in addition to the expected energy (fuel) efficiency gains \\nrealized with iterative improvements upon previous aircraft designs (including aerodynamic efficiency, lighter \\nweight construction, and improved taxiing and in-flight mechanical and electric systems). Given the potential \\nservice life of an aircraft – an average of 25 years – the scheduled phase-out of the existing fleet should \\ninclude the most robust technology available to meet the decarbonisation targets set. Depending upon the \\nmaturity of each technology as current aircraft are phased out and replaced, emission reductions of between \\n15% and 100% may be realized. However, aircraft are still not commercially available for the higher levels \\nof emission reductions potential.\\n\\uf0a7 T12 – Sustainable Aviation Fuel Integration Initiative: Integration of biofuels - sustainable aviation fuel \\n(SAF) - into the Air Kiribati operational fuel mixture provides an opportunity for immediate reductions in \\nemissions for all compatible aircraft and flights utilizing the fuel. SAF is slowly becoming commercially \\navailable from various sources, and various types of aviation-grade biofuels are developed across the \\nprivate sector. However, the supply of SAF is currently limited in the international market, and cost premiums \\nremain substantial. This will also require dedicated infrastructure in Kiribati for SAF storage and transfer. \\n\\uf0a7 T14 – Airport & Airfield infrastructure upgrade : Under the current and previous MSP, MICTTD has \\nidentified several recommended improvements to infrastructure supporting the aviation sub-sector. These \\ninclude facilitating efficient and effective air service as well as supporting safer and more secure operations \\ndomestically and internationally. Aviation infrastructure customarily consists of runways and taxiways, airport \\nbuildings and service facilities, and ground support equipment. Design and construction of infrastructure is \\na large factor in lifecycle GHG emissions for assets, but these emissions are not currently being captured \\nunder the domestic aviation category (e.g. included in energy and industry calculations). Runway upgrades, \\nhowever, may enable larger aircraft to conduct domestic travel, possibly reducing the emissions per \\npassenger/km travelled on individual flights. \\n3. NDC Investment Planning for Energy Efficiency (Power, Appliances, Buildings, \\nGovernment, Industry) \\nKiribati’s energy mix is dominated by imported petroleum and domestic coconut oil. The residential sector is the largest \\nconsumer of energy (53%) followed by transport (28%) and fishing (12%), while commercial buildings, government buildings \\nand industries together consume around 4%.64 Power generation from Public Utilities Board (PUB) is estimated to lead to \\nemission of approximately 19,000 tCO2 in 201865, approximately 20% of the national GHG emissions for 2019.66\\nKiribati is in its initial stages in implementing energy efficiency and the GOK is currently taking several measures to progress \\nin this area. The draft Energy Bill that has been presented for approval, has a strong focus on energy efficiency. In addition, \\nefforts are being made to integrate energy efficiency in the building code, further implement product energy standards and \\nlabelling (S&L) programme for refrigerators and freezers, and energy audits are being carried out in some Government \\nbuildings.67 \\nKiribati faces many challenges in terms of energy efficiency, the most significant being a lack of capacity to assess the \\nsituation of energy use and identify solutions for improving energy efficiency. Other challenges are characteristic of SIDS \\nand some of them are characteristic of energy efficiency itself. Energy efficiency is decentralised in its implementation and \\nmore difficult to measure and monitor than mitigation in power generation, and hence there are needs for an adequate \\nnumber of trained energy professionals, of which Kiribati currently lacks. From the point of view of financial institutions, the \\ndifficulty in measuring energy efficiency makes it appear to be a risky investment and thus increases the cost of financing. \\nGaining investment capital for financing energy efficiency is also difficult as the assets that are built through energy efficiency \\noften are not of high value, are spread over many locations or are not easily transferable making it difficult to be used as \\n64   Information shared by MISE during this assignment.\\n65   Estimate based on data shared by MISE during this assignment.\\n66   Estimate based on GHG inventory for 2019 prepared using data on fuel data shared by KOIL during this assignment, and information on renewable \\nenergy and non-commercial fuel from National Task Force, 2018, Scaling up Renewable Energy Programme (SREP) in Low Income Countries: Investment \\nPlan for the Republic of Kiribati, GOK.\\n67   Information shared by MISE during this assignment.'),\n",

The small size of the market in Kiribati also makes it a less attractive market for energy efficient products \\nor technologies, and for financial instruments which traditionally support the financing of these products or technologies. \\nEnergy efficiency in buildings has another specific challenge of a split incentive in that the owners of the buildings who must \\ninvest in energy efficiency measures may not be the direct beneficiary of the cost savings in case the building is occupied \\nby a tenant purchase the energy, which is the case of the few larger buildings in Kiribati.\\n3.1 Power and Appliances Sub-Sectors\\nThe power sector mainly relies on power from diesel generator (DG) sets supplemented by renewable based power, which \\nis mainly solar PV. PUB manages the power system in South Tarawa, including generation, transmission and distribution. \\nAs of January 2020, PUB has a total of 6 DG sets distributed between two power stations, the Bikenibeu power station, and \\nthe Betio power station, for a total of 6.85 MW. The Betio power station is used for peak load operations and has two diesel \\ngenerators, one with a nominal capacity of 625 kW and another with a capacity of 823 kW. Various operational parameters \\nof these DG sets are being recorded and data is available on a monthly basis. The total installed capacity of solar PV in \\nthe Gilbert islands is 1955 kWp, of which 1570 kWp is in South Tarawa where 503 kWp is off-grid. Distribution of electricty \\nis via a 11 kV of moslty underground cables, where the montly monitored Power Factor is ragnes between 0.90 to 0.95.68\\nPUB charges consumers fixed power tariffs for domestic, commercial, and industrial use. There is no fixed schedule in \\nKiribati for the revision of tariffs, which have been hisotrically changed on an as needed basis. The last revision of tariffs \\nwas in 2017 in which the only change made was to move from a fixed/flat tariff for domestic consumers, to a block tariff. \\nMainly of the tariffs are set below cost-recovery, and this is one of several reasons for PUB’s poor financial performance.69\\nThe Kiritimati electricity sector has now been organised into three separate grids from the previously existing several \\nisolated load centres.70 Outer Islands with larger populations are served with diesel micro-grids that often incorporate PV \\ngeneration. Smaller islands often depend upon individual diesel generators with no grid and/or solar home systems that \\nprovide minimal services like lighting.71 \\nBased on data from 2014, residential buildings consumed the highest amount of electricity (40%), followed by government \\nand industrial buildings (35%).72 In residences, the use of cooling electric appliances, such as fridge and fans, consumes \\nthe highest amount of electricity (40%), followed by devices for heating (35%) such as iron and electric water kettles and \\nthen lighting use (around 15%).\\nAn urban energy survey undertaken in Kiribati (South Tarawa and Kiritimati) in 2016, reveals how appliances are used in \\nurban residences as shown in the table below.73\\nTable 11: Ownership of household appliances (end use survey results)\\nAppliance Percent of \\nHouseholds* Comments\\nDedicated Electric Lighting 70% Mostly fluorescent tube\\nRefrigerators 10% 65% rate 2.5 out of 6 stars or lower based on AS/NZ standard (0 is lowest \\nand 6 highest)\\nFreezers\\n40% 55% rate 2.5 out of 6 stars or lower based on AS/NZ standard (0 is lowest \\nand 6 highest)\\nFans 70%\\nAirconditioning units limited\\nCooking with Kerosene NA Main source in South Tarawa\\nCooking with wood NA Main source in Kiritimati\\nTelevisions 30%\\nDVD players 80%\\n* approximate percentages\\n68  Information shared by PUB during this assignment.\\n69  National Task Force, 2018, Scaling up Renewable Energy Programme (SREP) in Low Income Countries: Investment Plan for the Republic of \\nKiribati, GOK.\\n70  National Task Force, 2018, Scaling up Renewable Energy Programme (SREP) in Low Income Countries: Investment Plan for the Republic of \\nKiribati, GOK.\\n71  Information shared by PUB during this assignment.\\n72  IRENA,SPC & PPA, 2017, Kiribati Integrated Energy Roadmap 2017-2025, GOK \\n73  UNDP, 2017, “Kiribati 2016 Urban Household Electrical Appliances, Lights, and End-use Survey”.'),\n",

The Kiribati \\nIntegrated Energy Roadmap (KIER) is a medium-term strategy document to guide the energy sector from 2016 to 2025. The \\nKIER, and the (Intended) NDC, sets a target for reduction of fossil fuel consumption through energy efficiency of greater \\nthan 16% in Kiritimati, Outer Islands and Tarawa. \\nKey Public Sector stakeholders relevant for energy efficiency in the power sector are PUB, MISE, KOIL and MOFED. The \\nprivate sector, especially from outside Kiribati, have a significant role in improving energy efficiency in the power supply \\nand distribution side, as the services of foreign suppliers and service providers are used for machinery supply and for major \\ntechnical assessments and maintenance activities. \\nKiribati participated in the Pacific Appliance Labelling and Standards Programme (PALS), led by PCREE-SPC and now \\nintends to initiate a product standards and labelling programme for air-conditioners, refrigerators and lighting products. A \\ndraft regulation proposed under the Consumer Protection Act, is awaiting Cabinet approval. Awareness raising activities \\nhave been carried out for customs officials. However, the design or costing of the S&L programme has not been done and \\nthere is lot of work remaining74. \\nMISE and MOFED have a significant role in the appliances sub-sector. From the private sector, the Kiribati Chamber of \\nCommerce and various suppliers and service providers would also have a significant role in terms of developing the market \\nfor energy efficient products and appliances. Owners and individual users of appliances also play a key role, in terms of \\nmaking right choices in procurement and also in terms of efficient operation and maintenance. \\nKey stakeholders and their roles are listed below, additional information on key stakeholders and existing planning and \\nactions in Land Transport can be found in Annex C.\\nTable 12: Key Stakeholders in Power and Appliances\\nStakeholder Roles within the sector\\nPublic Utilities Boards (PUB) PUB manages the power system in South Tarawa, including power generation, transmission \\nand distribution. \\nPUB will be key to ensure efficient operation and maintenance of existing assets such as \\ndiesel power plants and transmission and distribution systems, in designing and procuring \\nnew power generation systems that are energy efficient, including Li Ion battery for energy \\nstorage, and in special activities that influence energy efficiency like setting up and operating \\ndemand side management (DSM) and demand response (DR) programmes.

The DG sets in both the Bikenibeu and the Betio power stations \\nsuffer from lack of continual maintenance. As a result, the Bikenibeu power station operates at 65 % of its design capacity, \\nand requires most of the DG sets to be online to meet the demand. Without taking into account any design or inefficient \\noperation related issues, the delayed overhaul and low maintenance of these DG sets at the PUB power stations are likely \\nto lower the energy efficiency of the DG sets over time. PUB also faces the challenge to meeting peak demand and there \\nare currently no demand side management (DSM) and demand response (DR) programmes to help manage this. \\nEnergy efficient appliances require a higher initial investment compared to the alternative, while the life time savings occur \\nover a period of time. This additional upfront investment discourages investments in energy efficient appliances. Lask of \\nconsumer investments can be due to a lack of consumers awareness of the benefits of a higher star rated product, and \\ngoing for the least investment cost options. It could also mean that they are not convinced that the energy savings from a \\nhigher star rated product will be paid back durign operation.75 Once the exact reasons are known, these challenges can be \\ncountered by targeted measures. Standards and labelling (S&L) programmes have not yet been initiated for any products \\nin Kiriabati, creating opportunities for products with lower energy performance to enter the market.

It is assumed that these measures will indirectly contribute to an annual reduction of up to 1% of \\nthe national primary energy consumption, and the new information systems developed would support other energy \\nefficiency actions.\\n• E5 – Utility Led Programme to Manage Peak Demand and Savings in South Tarawa: This opportunity calls for \\nthe provision of technical assistance and training to the Public Utility Board (PUB) and MISE to control peak demand \\nand save energy in Kiribati through three initiatives: developing and implementing a demand side management \\n(DSM) programme; developing and implementing a demand response (DR) programme; and revision of the power \\ntariff to incorporate demand charges with time of day (TOD) tariff and power factor incentives/penalties for larger \\nusers. In support of the DSM and DR programme, training programmes, and awareness raising programmes and a \\nTV and social media campaign would be carried out and a guideline would be developed. \\nThe first initiative 78 under the DSM programme would promote the use of more efficient household appliances \\nthrough bulk procurement of higher energy efficiency household appliances by major retailers for distribution to \\napproximately 9,200 households on South Tarawa over a period of 6 years. The households would be encouraged \\nto return their old appliances to participate in this programme, which will be disposed of through means of recycle \\nin place at the time. A study would be undertaken for overall design of the DSM and DR programmes, including to \\ndetermine a feasible subsidy rate (consumer discount and/or taxation changes) for the appliances. A mechanism \\nfor on-bill financing would be developed to promote affordability.\\nThe DR programme component would involve identifying key non-critical loads in the grid that can be either shifted \\nto off-peak periods of operation or taken offline when there is demand driven stress on the grid. This programme \\n76  MISE is planning to initiate the S&L programme for air-conditioners, refrigerators and lighting products, though not much progress has been \\nmade. Depending on the progress being made, the project will support these three products/appliances or three other widely used products/appliances such \\nas fans, TVs, water pumps, washing machines\\n77  The Kiribati Solar Energy Company (KSEC) \\n78  This activity will have a close link to the product standards and labelling (S&L) programme being promoted in E7 as products that are energy labelled \\nthrough the S&L programme (if they are available during the period of the DSM activity) will be procured and distributed under the DSM activity. The \\nproposed DSM activity can help counter a potential increase in prices of the energy labelled appliances through the S&L programme and can help \\nincrease awareness of the benefits of these appliances. By the time the S&L programme is fully operational and effective, the DSM activity can be \\ngradually phased out, as the S& L will by themselves eliminate the low energy efficiency products from the market. However, the DSM programme can \\ncontinue with other demand side energy efficiency initiatives'),\n",

This will include the development and implementation of \\na capacity building, awareness raising and advocacy programme on the benefits of lithium-ion batteries over lead-\\nacid batteries, their proper use and approaches to offshore disposal. This initiative will also support the installation \\nof around 1 MWh of Li Ion battery storage for off-grid (by private individuals and firms) and on-grid installations (by \\nPUB). \\n• E9 – Programme on Efficient Operation and Maintenance of Diesel Power Plants: This mitigation opportunity \\ncalls for the provision of technical assistance to build the capacity of PUB and other stakeholders in Kiribati on the \\nproper installation and efficient operation and maintenance of diesel generation (DG) sets. Apart from four training \\nprogrammes, this will also include the development of a module in collaboration with KIT on the design, installation \\nand O&M of DG sets to be integrated within existing courses in KIT and/or offered as a separate course. Detailed \\nenergy audits will be conducted of PUB owned diesel power plants and technical advisory and financial support \\nwill be provided to PUB to undertake the necessary retrofits and overhauls. Policy recommendations will also be \\nprovided to incentivise individual consumers to go for solar PV installations instead of DG sets. As a result of this \\ninitiative, a minimum 5% reduction per year is expected in the specific fuel consumption (kWh/litre) of the PUB \\nmanaged diesel power plants.\\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\nMitigation Example: EGAT Demand Side Management – Thailand\\nIn 1993, through its electric utility Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), Thailand initiated a US$ \\n189M DSM program, with essential financing from an tariff mechanism and additional grant funding from GEF and \\nthe Government of Australia (total US$ 15.5M ) and a US$ 25M concessional credit guarantee from the Overseas \\nEconomic Cooperation Fund of Japan.  EGAT’s DSM Office started with four initiatives:\\n 1. A replacement programme switching fluorescent tubes: EGAT negotiated a voluntary agreement with  \\n all five Thai manufacturers and the sole importer of the less efficient T-12 fluorescent tubes to switch  \\n from producing and importing T-12 tubes to the more efficient T-8 tubes, and in return, EGAT supported  \\n a consumer information campaign. \\n 2. Refrigerator labelling programme: EGAT negotiated with the manufacturers a voluntary labelling   \\n scheme for refrigerators and EGAT sponsored a large advertising campaign to promote the scheme.  \\n EGAT also partnered with the Thailand Industrial Standards Institute to test domestically available   \\n refrigerators. In 1998, the labelling scheme was made mandatory, and in 1999 EGAT reached an\\n agreementwith the manufacturers to increase efficiency by 20% in the scheme.\\n 3. Air conditioner labelling programme: EGAT could not negotiate a voluntary agreement with the air- \\n conditioning industry, as it was more diverse and fragmented. Instead, considering the higher incremen \\n tal cost for labelled air-conditioners, EGAT worked with local credit card companies to offer interest-free  \\n loans for the incremental cost of Level 5 units, and also offered rebates to shop owners who sold Level  \\n 5 models during promotional summer periods. \\n  4. CFL bulk purchases: EGAT purchased CFLs in bulk and re-sold them through a distribution network  \\n  of convenience stores, leading to lower consumer costs. EGAT tested and labelled lamps to ensure  \\n  consistent quality and also paid for nationwide advertising costs. Over 900,000 CFLs were sold as of  \\n  early 2000, at 40 percent below the prevailing market price.\\nLater the programme was expanded with another 15 initiatives. Overall, the DSM programme resulted in a saving \\nof 570 MW in capacity and 3.15 GWh. The programme came in under budget and the cost of saved peak demand \\nwas much lower than the cost of supplying additional power. \\nKiribati has the opportunity to implement similar actions as defined in E1, E2, and E5 which expands upon the \\nexisting S & L programme for some appliances in Kiribati.  This includes setting up bulk procurement and commercial \\n/ retail financing facilities, and a domestic appliance testing facility.\\nSources: Iris M. Sulyma et al (2000).

The Building Code provides a standard design of the \\nfoundation of building which can be used by all buildings up to two storeys, whatever the location or soil conditions. Beyond \\ntwo storeys, each building needs a site-specific design of the foundation that also needs approval of MISE. The design of \\ngovernment facilities is done by the in-house architect at MISE, and the Energy Planning Unit at MISE is responsible for \\nthe design of the air-conditioning and lighting systems of government buildings.79 \\nConcrete blocks are the most commonly used material for construction, though are reported to be of poor quality. Other \\nstructural materials are timber (imported from Australia and New Zealand), and local materials with lower lifetime (pandanus \\nlogs, coconut logs and the coconut leaves). There is the possibility to increase the use of local materials, especially for \\ninterior, non-structural loads. Most buildings have metal roofs with water harvesting. Thatched roofs are used mainly in lower \\ncost buildings. Few buildings have insulation and these are mostly government buildings and education centre buildings.80 \\nThe major of industries in Kiribati are sea food processing, ice plants, and copra processing factories. Not much information \\nis available of their production process or of their energy performance. Kiribati Fish Ltd (KFL) is the only fishing company \\nengaged in processing and exporting of fresh and frozen fish.81 The key export markets for KFL fish products include \\nAustralia, Japan, the United States (US) and the European Union (EU).82 Solar powered ice plants have been constructed \\nin the outer islands to support the fishing industry.83\\n3.2.1 Key sector stakeholders and existing planning in Buildings, Government, Industry sub-sectors\\nThe Building Code was developed and enacted in 2017, which is a simplified adaptation of the Australian and New Zealand \\nBuilding Codes and focusses on structural and safety issues. The Code does not regulate houses and buildings made \\nentirely with local building materials like thatched roofs with coconut leaves. Most constructions in the outer islands are of \\nthis type. After 2 years of piloting the Building Code, MISE has realised that integrating energy efficiency into the Building \\nCode is critical.84 \\nAn energy audit programme for government buildings was initiated by MISE in 2012. There are around 15 ministries and \\neach of them have a few buildings and all these buildings were audited during the first round in 2012. Based on the audits, \\nfluorescent lamps and tubes were converted to LEDs in many of these buildings and in some of these buildings, ACs were \\nreplaced with fans. In 2019 MISE initiated a second energy audit of these buildings and plans to complete this in 2020. \\nThere is no audit programme yet for commercial buildings and hotels.85\\nMISE, MOFED and KIT are key public sector stakeholders in the construction sector. From the private sector, the Kiribati \\nChamber of Commerce and various suppliers and service providers would also have a significant role to play in improving \\nenergy efficiency in buildings. Owners and individual users of buildings also play a key role, in terms of making choices in \\nprocurement of material and equipment, and in terms of efficient operation and maintenance of the buildings.\\nThe industrial sector is very small in Kiribati and no specific policy or plans on energy efficiency exist for it. Copra and fish \\nprocessing are the only major industry and very little information is available on their operational details.\\nKey stakeholders and their roles are listed below, additional information on key stakeholders and existing planning and \\nactions can be found in Annex C.\\n79  Information shared by MISE during this assignment\\n80  Information shared by MISE during this assignment\\n81  GOK, Kiribati 20 year vision 1916-36\\n82  GOK, Kiribati 20 year vision 1916-36\\n83  Information shared by MISE during this assignment\\n84  Information shared by MISE during this assignment\\n85  Information shared by MISE during this assignment'),\n",

While the EEBC specifies minimum requirements and helps weed out poor \\nperformers from the market, the green building rating system incentivizes better performers to achieve higher building \\nenergy and environmental performance standards. There is also a lack of availability of environmentally friendly and low \\ncarbon building materials, and domestic designers and service providers have limited experience with these materials and \\ntechnology.

It covers both commercial and residential con-\\nstruction and is a joint effort by the CARICOM Regional Organisation for Standards and Quality (CROSQ), the \\nInternational Code Council and ASHRAE. The CREEBC establishes minimum energy efficiency requirements \\nfor buildings in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries using prescriptive and performance-related \\nprovisions covering the building envelope, heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, pumping and \\nlighting systems. \\nDuring the development of the Code, all Member States were required to establish National Committees to re-\\nview the base document and the recommended modifications identified by the consultant. It was endorsed by \\nthe CROSQ Council and approved by the CARICOM Energy Ministers in April 2018. The code will be updated \\nevery 6 years. \\nThe CREEBC is an adaptation of the International Energy Conservation Code, 2018 Edition, which includes the \\nANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2016. The requirements are specified based on specific climatic zones, and it \\nallows the use of building simulation software. It encourages improving maintenance practices by requiring main-\\ntenance information, equipment commissioning reporting, and documentation requirements. It also has provisions \\nfor application, enforcement and administration, such as defining which buildings and changes are required to \\ncomply with the code and the description of code officials’ roles and professional qualifications for building pro-\\nfessionals.\\nKiribati has the opportunity to implement a similar Energy Efficiency Building Code under opportunity E7, which \\nrequires developing and enacting the Energy Efficiency Building Code separate or in connection with the Struc-\\ntural Building Code. Then supporting its implementation via a financial support facility.  \\nSources: D.

Technical and financial support will be provided to implement the recommendations \\nof the audits in the 15 facilities. An ex-post audit would be conducted to assess the actual energy savings \\nachieved and ensure the proper use of fiscal incentives. The retrofits are expected to reduce energy \\nconsumption by up to 40% in each of the participating facilities. \\n• E4 – Promotion of Sustainable Public Procurement : This mitigation opportunity calls for technical \\nassistance and capacity building for the Central Procurement Unit (MOFED) for integrating sustainable \\nprocurement into existing public procurement rules and processes. This will also include the development \\nof sustainable procurement guidelines for high volume and high carbon intensity products. The mitigation \\nopportunity will support the implementation of cooperative procurement between government agencies in \\nKiribati and state-owned enterprises and/or larger private organisations.

Assuming 25 % reduction in energy consumption, around 340 Terra Joules is expected to be \\nsaved till 2030 due to the project interventions.\\n• E7 – Capacity Building in Assessment, Design and Construction of Low Energy/Carbon Buildings : This \\nmitigation opportunity will support the retrofit of up to 960 houses and 24 government buildings, as well \\nas support and build the capacity of MISE and other relevant stakeholders to participate in and enable a \\ntransition toward green buildings in Kiribati. The initiative will support retrofits in the participating buildings, \\nsuch as thermal insulation retrofits. Capacity of professionals would be developed through training and the \\ndevelopment of a curriculum and certified course for the design and construction of low-carbon buildings, \\nas well as in performing building energy audits. A certification system will be developed for low carbon \\nbuilding assessors, and rules and framework for the certification system. A low carbon building design and \\nconstruction guideline would be developed for different building types in Kiribati, which will contribute to \\nthe development of the energy efficiency building code, the green building rating system, and the use by \\nprofessionals for the design and construction of green buildings. Technical assistance will be provided to \\nthe GOK to develop the energy efficiency building code (EEBC) and a green building rating system. Energy \\nefficiency retrofits and expansion of green building and construction approaches are both an employment \\ncreation opportunity and a cost-saving measures for households and building operators. The retrofits in the \\nbuildings are expected to save up to 2,500 MWh up through 2030, assuming 15% energy savings achieved \\nin residential houses and 30% in government buildings. \\nMitigation Example: Voluntary Agreement Scheme on Energy Efficiency in Denmark \\nDenmark faced an important barrier in implementing industrial energy efficiency as it was not a strategic priority for \\nindustry, so the Danish Government took a stick and carrot policy approach. The Government took three actions \\n(1) placing a CO2 tax on all fossil fuels used by industries, (2) a refund of the all the CO2 tax for companies taking \\nvoluntary energy efficiency actions which were agreed with the authorities, and (3) offering subsidies for energy \\nefficiency actions. For the tax refund and subsidies, companies were required to operate certified energy man-\\nagement system (ISO50001), companies must investigate where savings could be made, and all measures with \\n4 year or less payback period shall be implemented. Evaluations of the scheme between 1996 and 2013 estimate \\nenergy savings of 5 – 6% in participating companies.\\nKiribati has the opportunity of implement a similar energy auditing and taxation incentive scheme for industry \\nunder E4.\\nSource: J.Vejen (2018) “Voluntary Agreement Scheme for Industries”, Danish Energy Agency.\\nin Denmark'),\n",

This individual financing pathway is divided into parts: \\n  Part A – Financing the preparation of the mitigation opportunities (or a part thereof) for implementation, and \\n  Part B – Financing the implementation and operation of the mitigation opportunities (or a part thereof). \\nIt is common that Part A is needed to secure financing for Part B.

These Project Development and \\nFunding Application(s) may directly fund project implementation or may fund Capacity Building activities for strengthening of \\ninstitutions before implementation, or fund Technical Assistance activities for feasibility studies and/or structuring financial \\ninstruments. Part B also has three components, the first of which is the Implementation and Operationalising of Financial \\nInstruments (one or more) which finance the physical activities of the mitigation opportunity, and can for example include \\na tax incentive or a loan facility. This is then supported by the other two components of Part B which may fund Capacity \\nBuilding activities for an institution’s long term operation of the mitigation opportunity, or fund Technical Assistance activities \\nfor continuous training of persons skilled in maintaining the mitigation opportunity. \\nFinancing\\nPreparation\\nProject Development\\nand\\nFunding Applications\\nImplementation and\\nOperating Financial\\nInstruments\\nCapacity Building\\nbefore ImplementationTechnical Assistance\\nbefore Implementation\\nCapacity Buildingduring OperationTechnical Assistanceduring Operation\\nFinancing\\nImplementation\\nA B\\nFigure 6: Individual Financing Pathway included in the estimated financing needs \\nEach of the mitigation opportunities for both the transport and energy efficiency sectors has different financing and financial \\ninstrument needs, and these are indicated in the individual Concept Notes found in the Project Pipeline associated with this \\nNDC Investment Plan.

The pathway is divided into three periods between 2020 and \\n2030. The first period (2020-2022) involves Part A – Financing Preparation under the individual financing pathway of all \\nthe primary mitigation opportunities, and Part B - Financing Implementation of a few primary mitigation opportunities which \\nwill require less preparation. The second (2023-2024) and third (2025-2030) involve a continuation of Part B – Financing \\nImplementation of all the primary mitigation opportunities.\\nTransport Sector\\nThe primary mitigation opportunities, as indicated in Section 4.1, for the transport sector during the period of 2020 through \\n2030 have a total indicative cost of US$ 163M, with a total indicative need for US$ 11.5M in capacity building & technical \\nassistance, and an indicative need for US$ 151.5M in investment capital. These primary mitigation opportunities have the \\npotential to reduce 115,400 tCO2 in the 2020 through 2030 period, and to reach a mitigation potential of 18,200 tCO2/yr in \\n2030. This is a potential mitigation of 23% of the estimated BAU baseline in 2030 as defined in the (Intended) NDC from \\n2016.88 This leads to a combined potential mitigation cost of 1,400 US$/tCO2.

According \\nto the OECD the net ODA for Kiribati in 2018 was US$ 74M91, which is 38% of the GDP of the country.92 In addition, flows \\nof personal remittance account for approximate US$ 20M in 2018.93\\nKiribati’s banking sector is limited to two primary banks, the first is the State Owned Enterprise (SOE) Development Bank \\nof Kiribati (KDB) which provides limited senior debt for special purpose commercial and retail loans.

Each of the mitigation opportunities for both the transport and energy efficiency sectors have different financial \\ninstrument needs and potential financing structures, and these are briefly indicated in the individual Concept Notes of the \\nincluded Project Pipeline of this NDC Investment Plan.\\nAll of the mitigation opportunities for the transport and energy efficiency sectors require Grants for Capacity Building and \\nTechnical Assistance, and most can utilise Non-Government Grants for Finance to enable the mitigation opportunities. The \\nState Budget & SOEs can provide a very limited amount of equity or in-kind finance for most of the mitigation opportunities, \\nbut there is a precedent in Kiribati that larger equity needs are financed through Non-Government Grants for Finance. \\nStakeholders in Kiribati have a broad level of experience with the aforementioned financial instruments.\\nThe private sector in Kiribati is small, the GOK budget and ODA are equal to 69% and 38% of GDP respectively in 2018, and \\nremittance is equal to only 10% of GDP in the same year. This indicates that GOK spending and ODA play a disproportionate \\nrole in the economy and may have a high impact on encouraging private sector investment in mitigation opportunities by \\ninfluencing the costs of goods and services. Given the GOK’s real limits of contributing to equity and debt, the Tariffs & \\nPrice Setting and Taxation are likely to be the most effective financial instruments within the control of the GOK which \\ncan encouraging private sector investment in mitigation opportunities. Especially for the mitigation opportunities where \\nbusinesses and households traditionally finance the majority of investment needs, such as for appliances and vehicles. \\nThis also holds true where higher revenues are needed to service debt and Return on Equity (ROE), such as with shipping \\nservices. The GOK can also encourage private sector investment through bulk government procurement, which can lower \\ncosts through economies of scale and the make more efficiency goods available to the second-hand internal market.\\nAfter equity availability, the private and public sectors availably of secured debt and its capital are likely the biggest \\nbottlenecks to finance mitigation opportunities in Kiribati. These elements and the ability to service debt are the reason why \\nODA is high in Kiribati. This is why external Guarantees for Credit and Export and Concessional Loans are clearly needed \\nin Kiribati to finance mitigation opportunities. The availability of these will also allow for greater down-stream private sector \\nlending for Commercial and Retail Senior Loans. In addition, Insurances products are needed to reduce the risk to lending, \\ncovering both the potential for property / asset losses, and performance losses.'),\n",

[These grant are previously applied across the \\nsectors in Kiribati] \\nNon-Government \\nGrants for Finance\\nThese grants are provided by various multi-lateral / bi-lateral institutions, and some development agencies \\n(who have gained funds from multi-lateral / bi-lateral institutions). For the absences of doubt these do not \\ninclude government support grants. [These grants are previously applied across the sectors in Kiribati]\\nGuarantees for \\nCredit\\nThese guarantees allow for risk reduction from parties defaulting on loan payments, and thus act as collateral \\nfor a type of loan or loan facility (incl. revolving loan funds). [These guarantees are previously applied across \\nthe sectors in Kiribati]\\nGuarantees for \\nExport\\nThese guarantees allow for risk reduction from parties defaulting on loan payments that finance specific \\ntechnology originating from a specific supplying country, and thus act as collateral for a type of loan. [The \\napplication of past guarantees for export to Kiribati are not known]\\nConcessional Loans\\nConcessional loans typically originate from IFIs or similar multi-lateral institutions and offer zero- / low-interest \\nrates, long grace periods, and long payback periods. They may finance individual projects or a pool of projects \\nand can act as a large loan providing capital for a pool of smaller loans. These may be backed by guarantees. \\n[These loans are previously applied across the sectors in Kiribati]\\nCommercial Senior \\nLoans\\nCommercial Senior Loans are typically administered by national banks (ANZ and KDB) and are used by \\ncompanies to finance no more the 80% of their activities, usually based on collateral of assets held by the \\ncompany or a guarantee from another source. [These loans are previously applied across the sectors in \\nKiribati]\\nRetail Senior Loans\\nRetail Senior Loans are typically administered by national banks (ANZ and KDB) and are used by individuals \\nto finance no more the 70% of their activities, usually based on collateral of assets held by the person, their \\nincome or a guarantee from another source. [The loans are previously applied across the sectors but limited \\nin Kiribati]\\nState Budget & \\nSOEs\\nThe State Budget allocates funds to projects to cover equity investment, provide a guarantee, co-finance \\nactivities, and possibly subsidies services. SOEs can also provide equity. [State Budget is previously applied \\nacross the transport sub-sectors, SOE equity is limited in Kiribati] \\nTariffs & Price \\nSetting: for energy \\nand services\\nThe GOK sets internal prices on fossil fuels, electricity, water, and maritime transport (passengers and cargo), \\nsome of which are influenced by indirectly subsidies to SOEs. Changes in the tariffs & pricing can influence \\nthe financial viability of investments and are also influenced by the politics for lowering the cost burden on \\nhouseholds. [tariffs & pricing are previously applied in Kiribati, but not always changed on a regular basis] \\nTaxation: import \\nduties & excise, \\ncorporate, personal\\nThe GOK has a robust and simple taxation system, and these can be used to increase or decrease import \\nduties & excise on technology to create price parity, provide tax holiday or income deductions to companies, \\nand provide income deductions to persons.

Conclusion\\nKiribati has one of the smallest economies in the PICs, and it cannot support all the transitional changes needed \\nto ensure low carbon transport and energy efficiency. The private sector (households and businesses) and public \\nsector (Government of Kiribati entities) will finance vehicles, outboard motors, buildings, industrial equipment, and \\nappliances without actions taken by the Government of Kiribati. There is no question that the vast majority within \\nthe private and public sectors of Kiribati will also go for the most affordable option available to them, which without \\nintervention will likely be the high GHG emissions option. The purpose of the primary mitigation opportunities defined \\nin this NDC Investment Plan are to support the private and public sectors in choosing the least GHG emissions option. \\nThe primary mitigation opportunities provide this support to encourage the private and public sectors in choosing of \\nthe least GHG emissions option, by ensuring that it is the only available option or is equal to or cheaper in cost to the \\nhigh GHG emissions option. This support is heavily grant dependent due to the realities of the economy in Kiribati, \\nthough there are some opportunities for encouraging the use of private sector debt and equity.  \\nThe main challenges and potential opportunities for increasing GHG mitigation in the transport and energy efficiency \\nsectors in Kiribati are defined in this NDC Investment Plan. It is clear that all of the primary mitigation opportunities \\nwill require international support in the form of capacity building, technical assistance, and finance for implementation. \\nCapacity building and technical assistance support are the foundation for each primary mitigation opportunity, and \\nthe level of finance support provided to these opportunities is directly proportional to the level of GHG mitigation \\nachieved for most of them. \\nDue to past financial sector activities, stakeholders in Kiribati have limited experience with the implementation of \\na significate portion of the financial instruments needed to finance the primary mitigation opportunities. Existing \\nlimitations are mainly due the scale of finance need for the financial instruments and complexity of this (including \\nblended finance). Additional capacity building and technical assistance will be needed to prepare individual financial \\ninstruments for each mitigation opportunity and scale them to the level needed to support significant GHG mitigation \\nin the transport and energy efficiency sectors. All of these financial instruments will include grants, and a few include \\nequity, debt, and fiscal policy/regulation changes which will need to work together as blended finance to ensure the \\nlevel of transition needed to reach the mitigation potential highlighted for each primary mitigation opportunity in this \\nNDC Investment Plan.\\nEach of the primary mitigation opportunities has an individual implementation timeline and financing pathway described \\nin the concept notes found in Annex A. Included within the implementation timeline are the immediate activities to be \\nundertaken to start the development and implementation of each primary mitigation opportunity. In addition to these \\nactivities, are a set of five broad sectoral short-term activities which can encourage the broader implementation of \\nthe NDC Investment Plan within the transport and energy efficiency sectors, and these are indicated in Table 23.'),\n",

As small vessels could make up 40%96 of the total emissions from maritime \\ntransport, a sizeable percentage of total emissions reduction for the sub-sector is available simply by \\ntransitioning from 2-stroke to 4-stroke outboards. \\nThis action aims to achieve a 40% reduction in emissions from outboards by 2030 from a combination \\nof switching to 4-stroke ULP and electric outboards. 4-stroke outboards are approximately 50% more \\nfuel efficient than 2-strokes97. Whilst there is no accurate data on the total number of outboards or \\ntype, based on estimates of ∼2000z small boats using 2-stroke outboards, this would see at least 800 \\n2-strokes being replaced with electric outboards by 2030. Transition to electric outboards requires \\nconsideration of charging technologies, and transition to 4-stroke or electric outboards involves several \\nsteps:\\n• household census of outboard ownership and use (including fuel use if possible) – ideally this \\nwould be nationwide to quantify the number and types of outboards in use and more accurately \\nestimate the GHG emissions – this could be built into the 2020 census which already collects data \\non boat ownership (by type e.g. wooded, aluminium, fibreglass, canoe) \\n• Review fiscal policy – this would include removing duties on 4-stroke and electric outboards, \\nlithium ion rechargeable batteries and chargers, parts, and raising import duties on 2-stroke \\noutboards initially and in time raising import duties on 4-strokes.\\n• Trial of e-outboards and recharging station at KNSL. Construction of a RE recharging station for \\nbatteries used in e-outboards and monitored trial on government and KNSL vessels of electric \\noutboards.\\n• Development of training course for marine mechanics on 4-strokes, electric motors and batteries/\\naccumulators\\n• Establishment of a zero interest loan facility for purchase of electric outboards or recharging \\nstations and related equipment and parts and low interest loan facility for purchase of 4-stroke \\noutboards\\nPublicity campaign to explain the planned transition to new generation outboard motors and the \\nassistance available to support communities in that transition\\nOutcomes\\n•\\t Reduced fuel use over time with uptake of more efficient outboard motors and sailing canoes and \\nsail assist leading to reduced economic cost of imported ULP, particularly for households and \\nfishers.\\n•\\t Opportunity for new businesses (4-stroke and electric outboard sales and servicing, and battery \\nrecharging)\\nRio Marker and CRS Pur-\\npose Code(s)\\nRio Marker: Principal (2)\\nOECD-DAC/CRS Purpose Code(s): 15155 - Tax policy and administration support; 21011 - Transport \\npolicy, planning and administration; 21013 - Transport regulation; 21040 - Water Transport; 21081 - \\nEducation and training in transport and storage; 23642 - Electric mobility infrastructures; 24030 – For-\\nmal sector financial intermediaries\\n96  RMI estimated emissions from vessels <15m powered by outboards represent 40% of maritime transport emissions (Oxley, 2018 ibid) https://\\nwww.theprif.org/documents/republic-marshall-islands-rmi/transport-maritime/prif-rmi-shipping-baseline-data-report, and Fiji Government estimates 12% of \\nmaritime emissions are from outboards from small boats <15 (not including those involved in fisheries or tourism) but it could be much higher (large margin \\nof error in data) Fiji Government (2018) Low Emissions Development Strategy https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Fiji_Low%20Emission%20\\nDevelopment%20%20Strategy%202018%20-%202050.pdf\\n97  See for example Johnson, D.

Studies of neighbouring countries including \\nMarshall Islands101, Tuvalu and Fiji have been used to estimate emissions profile from outboard \\nmotors for Kiribati.\\n•\\t It is assumed that emissions from outboards could constitute ∼ 40% of maritime transport emis-\\nsions102\\n•\\t It is assumed that a phased transition from predominantly pre-mix 2-stroke outboard to 4-stroke \\nto electric over a 10-year period will be required (with a mix of 4-stroke and electric motors) and \\nno increase in number of boats (and motors), rather replacement of existing motors only. \\n•\\t It is assumed that by 2030 40% of 2-stroke outboards would have been replaced by electric, with \\nonly a small number switching in the first few years and growing numbers thereafter. Emissions \\nreduction could also be achieved by replacing 2-strokes with 4-strokes but would require much \\nhigher proportion of replacement to achieve the emissions reduction projected of 40% by 2030.\\n•\\t It is also assumed that electric outboard batteries would only be recharged from renewable sourc-\\nes (predominantly solar PV). No costing is included for recharging batteries.\\n•\\t No emissions savings from reduced need to import fossil fuels has been included (such emis-\\nsions should be accounted for under IMO)\\nCo-benefits / SDG Link-\\nages\\n•\\t Reduced need for imported fossil fuels would lead to national and household budgets being \\navailable – i.e. improved purchasing power for women at household level particularly.\\n•\\t Reduced vulnerability to global fossil fuel price shocks.\\n•\\t Potential employment opportunities associated with sale, maintenance, installation, recharging \\nfor electric outboard motors.\\n•\\t Reduced risk of environmental damage/pollution from outboard motors.\\n•\\t Traditional knowledge of small canoe building and sailing becomes more appropriate and valued.\\n•\\t Replicable and scalable.\\n•\\t Relevant SDGs include 1, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17.\\nInvestment Needs (USD)\\nEstimated capital investment needed for the physical implementation: US$ 20,798,000\\nEstimated development costs: US$ 5,000\\nEstimated Enabling, Capacity Building and Technical Assistance Needs: US$ 805,000\\nPotential Business \\nModel and Financing \\nStrategy\\nThe transition away from 2-stroke outboard motors requires a phased approach and fiscal incentives, \\nsupported by capacity building, training and pilot trials. Whilst electric outboards are already available \\ncommercially in Australia, Fiji and elsewhere, small boat owners will not readily switch without proof \\nthat the technology works, and without addressing the differences in purchase cost (2-strokes are \\ncheaper, 4-stroke and electric outboards are considerably more expensive). \\nGrant financing will enable KNSL to pilot recharging and use of electric outboards in monitored trials to \\ndemonstrate the operational savings potential as well as use of the technology. Targeted scholarships \\nand training on servicing and use of 4-stroke and electric outboard motors through KIT and MTC will \\nprovide the human capacity.\\nOne business model to be explored for recharging is a “battery swap” as small businesses, with boat \\nowners collecting charged batteries and returning empty batteries for a fee (as happens with LPG \\ncylinders for cooking), as batteries make up a large part of the Capex and have limited lifespan. \\nThe financing strategy is a combination of fiscal policy (e.g. significant increase in import duties on \\n2-stroke outboards and lower duties for 4-stroke and no duties on electric outboards phased in over \\ntime) supplemented by a revolving low/zero interest loan facility. \\n100  Vahs et al (2019) (“Technical and Operational Options Catalogue: Proposal for technical and operational options to reduce fuel consumption and \\nemissions from inter atoll transport and inside lagoon transport” University of Applied Sciences Emden-Leer) in their calculations assume outboard motor fuel \\nconsumption of 0.55 l/h/HP noting that real fuel consumption is subject to many factors, such as engine type, hull shape, maintenance, currents, wind, wave \\nconditions, etc. and that fuel costs can be cut by 100% by use of traditional wind powered canoes. They estimate that 31.1 litres petrol (1x25 HP 2-stroke \\noutboard) would be used on a fishing trip of 31 km (17 km fishing speed and 14 km travel speed) and assuming one fishing trip/week, calculate use of \\ntraditional sailing canoe would save 1,617 litres of petrol (US$3,852) a year.\\n101 Emissions calculations for RMI Government vessel tenders with outboards found annual output from 8 outboard motors of 72.63 tonnes of CO2 and used \\n23.06 tonnes of petrol in 2017 (outboard motors 6 x 45 HP and 2 x 25 HP Yanmar Enduros).

They are primarily utilized by the private sector, generally at the individual/\\nhousehold level.\\nNational-scale bulk purchasing from preferred suppliers of standard and e-bicycles and spare parts should \\nbe arranged in coordination with lending agencies (DBK and ANZ) who provide commercial lending pack-\\nages at a significantly reduced interest rate to place higher quality bicycles and new e-bikes into circula-\\ntion, including a financial support guarantee provided to the lending agencies. Lending mechanisms may \\nrequire performance and loss & damage insurance as a part of the risk structuring. This lending is support-\\ned through a revolving fund replenished by private sector purchases to the retailer. \\nOn a household/individual level, fuel and vehicle costs should be promoted as avenues for greater cost \\nsavings. Though not all households will have access to retail lending at a small scale, especially to pur-\\nchase e-bicycles, therefore a micro-lending facility including a financial support guarantee provided to the \\nlending agencies will allow for financing access. . \\nMultilateral and bilateral partner support for technical assistance grants and project development funds to \\nsupport the service, maintenance, repair, and supply chain requirements to help the existing bicycle mode \\nshare expand and thrive.\\nGaps & Barriers to \\nImplementation, In -\\ncluding Proposed \\nenabling mechanisms\\n•\\t The establishment of a more robust maintenance and parts & service environment will be necessary \\nto ensure purchases stay in operable and in good repair through at least a 3-year lifespan (high qual-\\nity standard and e-bicycles can last to 5+ years).\\n•\\t Disseminating information around the lending mechanisms to encourage participation will be a sig-\\nnificant challenge for success.\\n•\\t As duty and excise designations for standard and e-bicycles are not properly grouped alongside VAT \\nexemptions issued for bicycles and bicycle parts, political will and effort on the part of government to \\namend this tax policy and forego future revenue from motorbike taxation must be aligned. \\n•\\t Importers and retailers may need to collaborate (where otherwise functioning competitively) to reduce \\npurchase costs for standard and e-bicycles through a government/DBK-aligned bulk purchasing sys-\\ntem.\\nFinancial Sustain -\\nability\\nUnlike some of the larger scale projects with massive capital outlay required for infrastructure investment, \\nthe financial sustainability of a standard and e-bicycle mitigation opportunities would be supported by a \\nsimple and low volume lending model and a broader customer base from amongst the private sector, \\nwhich will reduce the risk of non-payments of loans at the commercial and retail level.\\nAdditionally, transport costs associated with importation of standard and e-bicycle should be significantly \\nlower than with EVs or other motor vehicle alternatives. On a per-unit basis, for trips under 15km, bicycles \\nprovide the greatest increase in range and speed of land transport relative to the material and recurring \\ncosts to produce and operate, respectively. Sustainability should be achievable from a financing perspec-\\ntive with fewer required inputs from outside Kiribati.\\nThe TA for maintenance training will also help ensure longer life for standard and e-bicycles.\\nPotential Financing \\nand Need for Financial \\nSupport and/or Finan-\\ncial Instruments\\n•\\t Equity for Capital Investment: 25% of cost from Private Sector equal to US$5.1m over 2022-2030.\\n•\\t Debt for Capital Investment: 75% in lending support equal to US$ 15.2m over 2022-2030.\\n•\\t Credit guarantee for lending support: 75% equal to US$ 15.2m over 2022-2030\\n•\\t Grants for TA/CB and project development: 100% of total equal to US$790,000 over 2021-2030.\\n•\\t Taxation changes to reduce the cost of standard and e-bicycles, and possible increase the cost of ICE \\nmotorbikes and motorcycles over 2022-2023.\\nPotential Supporting \\nand Financing Part -\\nners / Sources\\n•\\t Management Partner (assisting with access to finance):*\\no Project Planning, Development & Design: DBK, UNESCAP, GGGI , NDC-Hub, ADB, World \\nBank/IFC, EEAS, PCREEE-SPC, UNCTAD\\no Project Implementation & Management: DBK, UNDP, GGGI, NDC-Hub, ADB, World \\nBank/IFC, PCREEE-SPC, World Health Organization, UNICEF, \\n•\\t Potential Financial Partners / Sources:* \\no Credit Guarantees: GCF, ADB, World Bank/IFC, EIB\\no Debts & Loans: DBK, ANZ, ADB, World Bank/IFC, EIB\\no Equity: PVU, Private Companies, households\\no Non-Government Grants for investment: AU-DFAT, NZ-MFAT, GCF, GEF, World Bank /\\nIFC, EIB, CIDCA, EEAS, KOICA, USAID\\no Grants for Technical Assistance & Capacity Building: GEF, AU-DFAT, NZ-MFAT, CTCN, \\nADB, GCF, World Bank/IFC, KOICA, EEAS, IRENA, UNDP, GGGI, UNESCAP, UNIDO, \\nPCREEE-SPC, GIZ, GEF, World Health Organization, UNICEF, \\no Government Budget & Taxes Incentives: MOFED\\no Risk Instruments: ADB, World Bank/IFC, EIB\\n*This is not a comprehensive list, other entities are possible as well.'),\n",

The scholarships could be sourced \\nfrom existing scholarship funding support (e.g. from Governments of Australia and NZ). An initial in-\\nvestment would be required to put together a grant application, identify potential sources of finance \\n(e.g. the PBSP, the proposed International Maritime Research Fund24, IMO, or bilateral partners25). In \\naddition to KNSL there are only a handful of private sector organisations involved in maritime transport \\nand the majority of boats are owned by individuals/households. One component of developing the NAP \\nwould be to quantify and establish a revolving zero/low-interest loan facility for private sector and Island \\nCouncils to access for decarbonisation of the domestic fleet.\\nGaps & Barriers to Im-\\nplementation, Including \\nProposed enabling \\nmechanisms\\n- Data availability – preparation for the NAP includes grant/technical assistance for data collection \\nand analysis focused on domestic maritime transport emissions. \\n- Human Capacity - lack of personnel within MICTTD and Marine Division (staff are already fully \\ncommitted) and with maritime emissions expertise (access to such expertise is available through \\nUSP MCST and MTCC); declining traditional knowledge on boat building and seafaring.\\n- Financing/Insurance – NAP would look to include establishment of loan facility to enable private \\nsector and households/individuals to access underwritten finances\\nFinancial Sustainability\\nOngoing financial support will be required for staff salaries and scholarships. Staff salaries after 2030 \\nwould be built into the Government National Budget allocation26. Funding for data collection and anal-\\nysis in order to develop the NAP and amendment of regulations would be a one-off requirement, and \\nongoing data collection required for MRV purposes would be built into existing Government NDC data \\ncollection programmes. \\nThe NAP is an overarching policy document, and as such is instrumental in identifying funding oppor-\\ntunities for pilot project implementation. In this regard, lessons learnt from past shipping pilot projects \\nand other development aid are important. \\nThe PBSP is one multi-country response to these experiences and provides a different paradigm for \\ntransition of the shipping sector in the Pacific, focussing on collaboration and cooperation to imple -\\nment shipping decarbonisation from a country-driven perspective. PBSP seeks to raise US$0.5 billion \\n(blended loans and grants) for participating countries to access and if successfully established rep-\\nresents the best option for securing financing for the sector in Kiribati. Securing grants for purchase \\nof new ships is notoriously difficult, with the major infrastructure banks active in the region (ADB, WB) \\nonly funding land-based infrastructure (e.g. ports and jetties) and not vessels. The past few years \\nhas seen a plethora of donor-driven projects in the electricity sector which are often un-coordinated, \\nshort-lived, and poorly monitored or reported (with project reports emphasizing perceived success and \\nfailing to mention what didn’t work – often the most important thing governments need to know) as \\nwell as placing additional project management, input and oversight burden on already over-committed \\ngovernment officials.

There are significant challenges with such donations and Kiribati and the rest of \\nthe Pacific are strewn with wrecked or un-operational boats from past donor projects. The \\nmuch higher upfront Capex costs of purchasing a new purpose-built vessel versus a sec-\\nond-hand vessel limit commercial bank options (neither ADB nor WB have funded purchase \\nof vessels, instead funding grants and loans for ports, jetties, and other maritime transport \\ninfrastructure). \\nPBSP offers an alternative potential future funding source 17, enabling GOK to access a re-\\ngional funding pool made from blended financing sourced from mixture of grants and loans. \\nPBSP will target GCF and other sources of funding to provide a pool of blended finance for \\nparticipating Pacific governments and private sector to access specifically for a suite of ship-\\nping decarbonisation initiatives. PBSP is therefore the proposed financing strategy for this \\nand the other maritime transport pilot projects.\\nOperational costs (crew wages, vessel maintenance and fuel) would be from within national \\nbudget allocation for KNSL and revenue generated from freight charges (the latter being \\nindirectly subsidised through GOK copra payments and import levies directed to underwrite \\ncosts of inter-island transport).    \\nGaps & Barriers to Im-\\nplementation, Including \\nProposed enabling \\nmechanisms\\nThe action is relatively straightforward in terms of technology availability with a range of \\ncomparable vessel types and relevant technologies in design stages globally. Research into \\nthe specific routes envisaged are needed to model best fit options relative to wind, sunlight, \\ntechnology capacity, etc. MCST’s network of technical research centres is available to assist \\nin this. It is assumed the vessel would be built in class, the design investment then being \\nreplicable in any other SIDs/LDC location.\\nThe greatest barrier is gaining economic consensus that a higher Capex model to develop \\nthe vessel is tradable for a much lower Opex. As a first mover, the increased cost of Capex \\nshould be source-able to global grant finance.\\nKiribati has no naval architecture or construction capacity so the build would have to be \\nundertaken offshore. If undertaken as an incentivised design competition challenge there \\nwould be high interest from a number of maritime research academies. \\nKiribati has a human capacity of international mariners. New technologies would require a \\nlevel of retraining and capacity development. However, KNSL are well experienced in oper-\\nating vessels of this scale.\\nThis action will require institutional support to KNSL and Marine Division for business case, \\ndesign, build and operational aspects. The vessel once operational provides training and \\ncapacity development opportunities for both KIT and MTC cadets.\\nFinancial Sustainability\\nThis action aims to improve Kiribati’s national financial sustainability by providing a State-\\nowned asset that can transport cargo (imports and exports) between the island groups and \\nwithin the region (on international routes). Kiribati is currently dependent on external provi-\\nsion of such transport services making it particularly vulnerable to increased freight costs \\nand lack of regular connectivity to markets. Purchase of a new vessel will reduce annual \\noperating and maintenance costs which are covered by the national budget, with a more ef-\\nficient vessel having lower fuel costs for example, i.e. higher Capex but lower Opex over the \\nlifespan of the ship. Use of retrofitted wind-hybrid technology to reduce fuel use has proved \\nsuccessful in making the SV Kwai (owned and operated by Island Ventures Ltd) financially \\nviable on international route from Hawaii to the Line Islands32.

Given \\nthe lack of a market economy, the long distances and small populations/cargo volumes, it is \\nunrealistic to expect that inter-island shipping can be financially sustainable without subsidy/\\nsupport. \\nThe focus of this action is therefore on reducing annual operational costs by reducing fossil \\nfuel use and in reducing GHG emissions. Annual diesel and oil spend by KNSL are ∼US$0.5m \\nfor the two existing landing craft, and fuel savings through better boat design and use of re-\\nnewables for propulsion and auxiliary power have potential to decrease operational cost by \\nup to 60% when compared to the existing landing craft used for this purpose. \\nPotential Financing and \\nNeed for Financial Sup -\\nport and/or Financial \\nInstruments\\nThis action would need to be either a. fully externally publicly financed as a pilot and research \\ndemonstration through PBSP for example or b. as a PPP with an experienced operator.

The applicability, appropriateness, and financial \\nviability of some of these fuels needs to be considered carefully via technical assistance, as the cost and \\npracticality of using some of these is likely to be prohibitive in the PICs at this time. Technology piloting in \\nthe maritime sector is ongoing, but biofuels in land transport, especially biodiesel (<B10) and ethanol (<E10) \\nblending, are already used and mandated extensively in Brazil, Europe, North America, Indonesia, and al-\\nready blended and shipped from Singapore.\\nThis action focuses on importing the high-quality blended biofuels. Two actions can be taken: 1) a require -\\nment that all imported biofuels include a blend such as B7 and E5 to start with which is medium amount as \\nin the EU and compatible for EURO-3 vehicles are higher, this can raise up to 10% blending in 2030 when \\nEURO-5 vehicles or higher are on the road. 2) allow for the availability of dual fuel types, e.g. bio-blends and \\nregular fuels and later phase to only biofuels after 2030. Note that biodiesel blending will also affect the power \\ngeneration sector, and this option influences emissions in that sectors as well, and all imported fuels will be \\nblended. This option will require infrastructure investments. Action 1 only requires new terminal storage facil-\\nities. Action 2 requires more investment in terminal storage facilities, as well as pumps/mini-storage to petrol \\nstations. Both actions will require a minimum standard for vehicle (e.g. EURO-3). The price of blended fuels \\nwill likely be higher than standard fuels, and this will depend on the global oil prices. Tax policy can level out \\nthe price parity of the fuel types and potentially make biofuels cheaper to the consumer.\\nThere are also efforts in PIC to develop biodiesel industry via. Coconut production. These efforts have mainly \\nfocused on power generation, and not transport, and have face several bottle necks. Some of these are \\ntechnical such as quality of fuel, but also economic where low diesel prices do not incentivise farmers to \\nsell coconut oil / copra for biofuels when they get better prices from other markets. This regional & national \\nproduction of biofuel is not considered in this action. '),\n",

The business model is highly dependent on changes in taxation which \\nencourages the consumer price to be at least in parity to blended and non-blended fuels, or blended fuels \\nbeing slightly cheaper. \\nA grant is needed for the estimated Enabling, Capacity Building and Technical Assistance Needs\\nThere are two financing models for development and implementation:\\nModel 1 – Includes a 100% grant for project development costs and implementation. Under this model only \\nthe imported fuel price parity will affect the GOK revenues and/or consumer prices.\\nModel 2 – Includes a concessional or other low interest loan taken out by Government or KOIL to provide \\ndebt, and a development loan guarantee for this amount will be needed. Equity will be gained from KOIL or \\nGOK. This model will affect the GOK revenues and/or consumers prices.\\nGaps & Barriers to \\nImplementation, \\nIncluding Proposed \\nenabling mecha-\\nnisms\\n- The availability of biofuel blends in the Pacific region, including the likelihood of availability for shipping \\nfrom Fiji, or directly from Singapore or Taiwan. Sourcing and contractual assistance will be needed.\\n- Public knowhow on blended biofuels will need to be strengthened (to reduce fears), where a public \\ndissemination programme is needed.\\n- Euro-3 vehicle or higher will be needed, therefore a restriction on the import of any vehicles less than \\nEuro-3 will be required.\\nFinancial Sustain -\\nability\\nThe business model is highly dependent on changes in taxation which encourages the consumer price to \\nbe at least in parity to blended and non-blended fuels, or blended fuels being slightly cheaper. \\nIf the infrastructure upgrades at the terminals and petrol stations are financed under a favourable model 40 \\nthen the nominal cost increase to the consumer would be a minimum of US$ 0.08 per l for all fuels. In addi-\\ntion, biofuel blends have a volatile price due to swings in both oil prices and pure-biofuel price, but blends \\nare typically 10-15% higher per litre than non-blends. '),\n",

This will require a \\nblended finance model, inclusive of infrastructure lending. Multilateral development banks should couple \\nconcessional loans and guarantees with financial grants, and multi-lateral and bilateral parties can provide \\ntechnical assistance/capacity building grants to develop a qualified labour force to support decentralized \\nbus operations. Revenue from the general public can partially cover the capital costs associated with estab-\\nlishing the bus fleet, and to recover costs associated with operating and maintaining the network nationally.\\nThe PPP model will include the government setting passenger tariffs, enforcing payment, and remove \\nlicences of other transport operators (usually running mini-buses and vans). The government will then \\nfranchise the bus route in a competitive process.\\nThe private party of the PPP will have access to a lending facility for debt and grants to cover the equity \\nportion of investments. the Private party will also have access to free driver and maintenance training \\n(support by grants)\\nGaps & Barriers to \\nImplementation, \\nIncluding Pro-\\nposed enabling \\nmechanisms\\n•\\t The largest gap in place at the moment is the absence of a robust legislative/regulatory structure for \\nthe establishment and operation of a national public transport system. (The school bus system can be \\nexamined and lessons may be learned as to the operational and financial management of this service \\nto expand to the entire population.) \\n•\\t The primary barrier to uptake of the multi-modal transport is fostering behaviour change and inducing \\na shift from private vehicle use. The private ICE vehicle import duty and registration rates may be in-\\ncreased to prohibitive levels to disincentivize the import and registration of new vehicles and stimulate \\nrapid uptake of a newly established national transit system. The zero-rating of bicycles has shown \\ncontinued interest in their utilization for short-distance travel, with continued growth of imports. If a flat \\nannual fare is assessed for transit users, matched to be competitive against the cost of registering a \\nvehicle, it can be included as an optional addendum to existing taxes to distribute the cost across the \\nyear and reduce the burden of upfront payment and eliminate the inconvenience of pay-as-you-ride \\nfares. \\n•\\t One of the barriers to full decarbonisation under the transit model is the need for establishment of the \\nelectric vehicle infrastructure which is extraordinarily costly. The transit system can be established \\nwithout requiring additional infrastructure and realize >87% emissions reductions in the land transport \\nsub-sector if fully implemented.\\nFinancial Sustain -\\nability\\nAs mentioned above, the multi-modal transport system would not be sustainable if fully funded domestical-\\nly. From established estimates in other markets, the operational costs over the lifespan of buses will make \\nup the bulk of the overall cost, so sustainably operating (even discounting the capital costs) is not likely to \\nbe viable without continued subsidies and high ridership. This is where the primary barrier of fostering be-\\nhaviour change away from private vehicle use will be instrumental in improving the margins on operations \\nand reducing the required subsidies from government and donor agencies. Consequential reductions in \\nfuel imports will improve viability on a national level, and help substantiate taking the approach of estab-\\nlishing a nationalized system managed through the island councils instead of turning over operations of a \\nbus network to a private sector operator, which would not be able to operate profitably without substantial \\nfavourable subsidies.\\nPotential Financ -\\ning and Need for \\nFinancial Support \\nand/or Financial \\nInstruments\\nFinance from both bilateral partners and multilateral development institutions will be necessary for the \\nvehicle assets and supporting infrastructure required to establish a national transit network for the general \\npublic to reduce the need for private vehicle travel, as well as for capacity building and technical assistance.\\nIn the event the government wants to license private operators to provide transit services under a public-pri-\\nvate partnership (PPP) model this may open financing from IFC and commercial lenders. Insurance will \\nneed to be provided by the GOK, potentially guaranteed by external financial institutions.\\nGrants for Capital Investment (both supporting infrastructure and vehicles): 30% of total cost for buses \\nequal to US$10.35m Phase 1 and US$ 11.97m Phase 2, 100% of total cost for bus-stops and maintenance \\nterminals equal to US$15m Phase 1.44'),\n",

There are only 20 residents. One of Earth’s last remaining marine wilderness areas, \\nit helps protect Kiribati’s unique biodiversity and large tuna population and represents one of \\nthe world’s few remaining places in pristine condition. A pilot ‘zero-impact’ small scale cruise \\nliner (40-50 pax) operating from Tarawa would provide a unique marketing edge for devel-\\noping a niche zero impact tourism industry in a country with limited options for sustainable \\nemployment or foreign exchange earnings.\\nDeveloping zero impact tourism to the PIPA as a sustainable development measure is sought \\nby the government. Potential is thought to be similar to Galapagos. The vessel can multi-task \\nas a monitoring station for the PIPA. The vessel, most likely a catamaran, will need to be a \\ntrue blue-water vessel capable of being self-sufficient over 2,500 NM routes and would need \\nto have zero impact on the maritime/terrestrial environment and a zero-carbon operating \\nfootprint resulting in a high Capex/low Opex profile. \\nInitial ‘proof of concept’ design would include wind/electric hybrid propulsion, RE (biofuel/\\nsolar/wind) auxiliary and hotel, advanced hull design and battery support.\\nOutcomes\\n•\\t Maximised opportunity for tourism development as source of foreign exchange earnings\\n•\\t Diversified employment opportunity for Kiribati seafarers and hospitality workers\\nRio Marker and CRS \\nPurpose Code(s)\\nRio Marker: Principal (2)\\nOECD-DAC/CRS Purpose Code(s): 15155 - Tax policy and administration support; 21011 - \\nTransport policy, planning and administration; 21013 - Transport regulation; 21040 - Water \\nTransport; 21081 - Education and training in transport and storage;'),\n",

If undertaken as an incentivised \\ndesign competition challenge there, would be high interest from a number of maritime re-\\nsearch academies, so providing GOK increased potential for additional voluntary and in-kind \\ncontributions. \\nIt is anticipated that the vessel would be operated by KNSL in a PPP and income from in-\\nternational tourists used to cover costs of crew salaries and vessel operations and mainte-\\nnance, as well as contribute a source of income for i-Kiribati seafarers and relevant island \\ncommunities. \\nGaps & Barriers to Im-\\nplementation, Including \\nProposed enabling \\nmechanisms\\nThis is a niche action, to develop a commercially operated demonstration vessel and pres-\\nents unique challenges. It would require a significant capacity development element in both \\nmaritime and cruise liner hospitably marketing, management, training, and need to be care-\\nfully supported by the right combination of external partners in project design for both the \\nvessel itself and the zero-impact cruise operation. \\nThere is currently almost zero tourism activity in Kiribati due to the limited number of direct \\nflights and distance. However, tourism offers one of few available sustainability pathways \\nfor diversifying from fisheries licences. This initiative would be in line with the government’s \\ncurrent $250m investment in direct air services to NZ, Fiji and Australia. While barriers of re-\\nmoteness, size and total isolation are not insignificant, they are also marketing strengths for \\na narrow but growing eco-traveller market. Despite this advantage, the action would face the \\nbarriers of any first mover start up operating on one of the most remote routes in the world, \\nwhere sources of finance for new vessels and insurance are few and far between. Kiribati \\nhas no naval architecture or construction capacity so the build would have to be undertaken \\noffshore.\\nThis action will require institutional support for both the maritime and tourism aspects, includ-\\ning feasibility studies, data collection and analysis, etc. Kiribati has a surplus of internationally \\nexperienced seafarers but most without cruise experience and it is expected specific up-skill-\\ning and training would be required.\\nFinancial Sustainability\\nThis is a high-risk action, given its dependence on international visitors 48, and would require \\nongoing support. As with projects above, sources of such grant funding are extremely limited, \\nand the PBSP has highest potential. This pilot is focused on taking advantage of an opportu-\\nnity (to diversify income through tourism development) in the medium term (3-5 year).\\nIncome generated from tourism could be used to contribute to costs of operations (crew \\nsalaries, vessel maintenance, etc) but would take time to establish. Financial sustainability \\nwould also be highly dependent on GOK ability to attract international tourists to Kiribati, and \\nability to attract a suitable private niche cruise operator to run cruise liner tourism business.

Secure technical assistance and capacity building support for items B, C, and D below.\\nB. Prepare a new policy (or regulation) for inclusion of non-fossil fuel-powered aircraft in accor-\\ndance with domestic and international aviation regulations.\\nC. Update aviation infrastructure design standards in accordance with expected electric/fuel cell \\naircraft utilisation.\\nD. Enter into discussions with supporting agencies for primary investment financing and state bud-\\nget allocations following the COVID-19 recovery.\\nPotential Business Model \\nand Financing Strategy\\nThe combination of leasing arrangements with concessional loans backed by guarantees is expected \\nto reduce risk associated in acquiring new, high-value assets such as aircraft.\\nWith only the State-owned air carrier operating in Kiribati, the involvement of the private sector is \\ncurrently minimal, though additional charter flight businesses have existed in the past.\\nThe most appropriate approach to financing the re-fleeting of aircraft for domestic routes will involve \\nofficial development assistance from bilateral partners, coupled with concessional lending guaran -\\nteed by multilateral development banks where available as co-financing. Repayment on loans can be \\nsupported by savings accrued through efficiency improvements and reductions in fuel expenditures \\nto Air Kiribati accrued during operation of next-gen aircraft.\\nGaps & Barriers to Im-\\nplementation, Including \\nProposed enabling \\nmechanisms\\n•\\t The primary barriers to implementation are funding gaps for capital expenditure, which need to \\nbe resolved prior to re-fleeting. Additionally, the scaling barriers to cost-competitive uptake of \\nnew technology need to be remedied at a global market level before Kiribati will be able to take \\nadvantage of the next generation of  decarbonised aviation. \\n•\\t Human capacity development for both ground and flight crews would need to be developed to \\nensure proper operation of the aircraft.\\n•\\t Given the long lifespan of the asset, concessional loans combined with technical assistance \\ngrants should bring down the interest rates and reduce payback periods while ensuring effi-\\nciency gains are maximized in the recurring OPEX of the aircraft. Leasing arrangements with \\nmanufacturer support would assist in ensuring these gains, as well.\\nFinancial Sustainability\\nThe financial sustainability of the re-fleeting process will be dependent upon three factors, assuming \\na service life of 20+ years for the aircraft; a) the capital outlay for the new aircraft, b) the percentage \\nof savings associated with efficiency and alternative propulsion fuels, and c) the revenue increases \\nprovided through higher passenger volume per km travelled. At the low end of the spectrum (US$12m \\nper aircraft), US$600,000 per annum in avoided fuel costs and increased revenue to pay itself off \\nwithin 20 years. At the higher end, (US$32m per aircraft), this figure rises to over US$1.6m per an-\\nnum. Given the total recorded jet fuel consumption for 2019 was reported by KOIL at 2.5m litres, with \\na wholesale price well under US$1.00 per litre, eliminating the entirety of Kiribati’s international and \\ndomestic aviation fuel use would not be sufficient to meet the payback period for even two of the six \\nplanes if replaced on the proposed re-fleeting schedule. To ensure financial sustainability, the provi-\\nsion of outside grant financing to subsidize the cost of aircraft replacement will be necessary to avoid \\nfinancial losses over the lifespan of the aircraft. \\nPotential Financing and \\nNeed for Financial Sup-\\nport and/or Financial \\nInstruments\\nWith an expectation of outer island airports being upgraded to accommodate aircraft at the scale of \\nthe DeHavilland Dash-8, the list price of the current production model (Dash-8 400) exceeds US$33.5 \\nmillion, so to deliver an equitable level of service and capacity with new tech, it is expected the in-\\nvestment cost for the replacement of the existing fleet of six aircraft will exceed US$201 million for \\nfull re-fleeting. Supporting infrastructure will accrue additional costs beyond the capital expenditure \\nmade on the aircraft alone. \\nIt is expected aircraft re-fleeting will be financed through concessional lending, or through a structured \\noperational/financial leasing arrangement, as per Air Kiribati and MOFED preferences.\\n•\\t Grants for Technical Assistance & Capacity Building: 100% of total cost equal to US$1.2\\n•\\t Grants for capital expenditures: 90% of total cost equal to US$180.9\\n•\\t State Budget: 10% of total cost equal to US$20.1m\\n•\\t Insurance: For loss and damage'),\n",

Introducing EV technology141 creates both a shift in energy \\nstorage and distribution requirements, as well as the current market access and profile of vehicles. \\nUnlike the existing paradigm, in which individuals and households primarily purchase second-hand ve-\\nhicles, the lack of maturity in the EV market means a robust second-hand vehicle market is not readily \\navailable to replace the second-hand ICE imports.\\n•\\t The infrastructure requirements include electric vehicle service equipment (EVSE), as well as \\ndesignated carport space.142 \\n•\\t The rationale for the transition to electric vehicles for motorized land transport relies upon rec-\\nognizing the opportunity for decarbonisation of the sub-sector alongside increased installation \\nof renewable energy infrastructure. Vehicle-based energy storage provides the opportunity for \\nvariable tariff rates contingent upon supply/demand electricity load curves. \\n•\\t It is estimated that there are 3,300 actively operated cars / SUVs / pickup trucks in Kiribati in 2020. \\nIn addition, there is an estimated average fuels increase in land transport of 6.7% annually be-\\ntween 2014 and 2019. Given this growth rate it is expected that up to 11,200 cars / SUVs / pickup \\ntrucks will be imported between 2022 and 2030, and there will be up to 7,000 actively operated \\ncars / SUVs / pickup trucks on the roads in Kiribati in 2030. This mitigation option proposes that up \\nto 2,800 new EVs will be on the road in 2030 which is equal to 38% of the total for such vehicles.143 \\nThis mitigation options includes the EVs and one Level 2 charger per vehicle.  \\n•\\t This mitigation option does not include additional (RE) power generation or power distribution \\nsystem upgrades.\\n141 Electric vehicles are currently found predominantly in Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) configurations for 2- and 3-wheel vehicles, and Permanent \\nMagnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) configurations are most common for private and commercial automobile applications (cars and buses).\\n142  EVSE set-up requires a universal Society of Automobile Engineers (SAE) International J1772 connector for domestic (Level 1) or dedicated (Level \\n2) charging. Variations have been developed for direct current (DC) fast charging, but applications for vehicles on the consumer market are not as readily \\navailable currently.\\n143 Example 60% of Norway’s new car market are EVs in 2020.

However, EV transition requires significant investment, and public sector purchases \\nwill likely constitute the majority of financing contributed towards the vehicle purchase cost for early \\nadoption. The additional cost of charging infrastructure will be seen as an entirely separate, and likely \\nunappealing secondary cost, which may not be marketable unless paired with RE generation capacity \\nsufficiently scaled for household/business/institutional needs.\\nThe proposed development of the EV Network would need to be attached to tax concessions and \\nlending packages that remove the existing price premium of EVs and Level 2 charging stations for \\nhousehold/individually owned vehicles, and Level 2 charging stations for commercially/institutionally \\nowned vehicles.

For \\nthe purchase of EVs and charging stations a new tax policy will be required which increases taxes on \\nfossil fuel vehicles and significantly reduces them from EVs to ensure something close to price parity.  \\nIn addition, a subsidy may be required per purchase, depending on the structure of the new tax policy. \\nThis subsidy is sourced either through direct government funding or ODA grants. In addition, a lending \\nfacility would need to be established to allow for retail (household) and commercial (dealers) lending \\nto purchase EVs, charging stations, and equipment/spares as these will exceed the normal value and \\nduration of loans currently issued for vehicle in Kiribati, and this would require a credit guarantee and \\nmay be performance and loss & damage insurance as a part of the risk structuring. The introduction of \\nEVs depends heavily on continued imports of technology manufactured elsewhere, and without signif-\\nicant donor commitment, this may not be achieved or sustained independently.\\nPotential Financing and \\nNeed for Financial Sup -\\nport and/or Financial \\nInstruments\\n•\\t Grants for Capital Investment: 90% of EV infrastructure cost equal to US$16.4m.\\n•\\t Equity for Capital Investment: 25% of vehicle cost from PVU/Private Sector equal at least to \\nUS$21.1m.\\n•\\t Debt for Capital Investment: 75% in lending support from DBK/ANZ (guaranteed by ADB, World \\nBank, EIB, or MOFED) equal up to US$63.2m\\n•\\t Grants for TA/CB and project development: 100% of total equal to US$3.09m \\n•\\t State Budget: 10% from the Government of Kiribati (MOFED/PUB) for infrastructure, equal to \\nUS$1.8m\\n•\\t Other financial instruments may be needed to ensure price parity of EVs of other vehicles (e.g. \\nchanged in duty, VAT, and excise changes).\\nPotential Supporting \\nand Financing Partners \\n/ Sources\\n•\\t Management Partner (assisting with access to finance):*\\no Project Planning, Development & Design: DBK, UNESCAP, GGGI , NDC-Hub, ADB, \\nWorld Bank/IFC, PRIF, IEA, IRENA, CTCN, EEAS, PCREEE-SPC, UNIDO, USP, \\nUNCTAD\\no Project Implementation & Management: DBK, UNDP, GGGI, NDC-Hub, ADB, World \\nBank/IFC, CIDCA, EEAS, PCREEE-SPC, USP\\n•\\t Potential Financial Partners / Sources:* \\no Credit Guarantees: GCF, ADB, World Bank/IFC , EIB, EXIMs\\no Debts & Loans: DBK, ANZ, ADB, World Bank/IFC , EIB, GCF\\no Equity: PUB, PVU-GOK, Private Companies/Vehicle Owners\\no Non-Government Grants for investment: GCF, ADB, GEF, World Bank/IFC, EIB, CID-\\nCA, EEAS, KOICA, AU-DFAT, NZ-MFAT, USAID\\no Grants for Technical Assistance & Capacity Building: GEF, AU-DFAT, NZ-MFAT, CTCN, \\nADB, GCF, World Bank/IFC, KOICA, EEAS, IRENA, UNDP, GGGI, UNESCAP, UNI-\\nDO, PCREEE-SPC, GIZ, CIDCA\\no Government Budget & Taxes Incentives: GOK\\no Risk Instruments: ADB, World Bank/IFC , EIB\\n*This is not a comprehensive list, as other entities are possible as well.\\nEnabling, Capacity \\nBuilding and Technical \\nAssistance Needs\\n1.

It is commercially available from various sources, \\nand various types of aviation-grade biofuel are being developed across the private sector, having been in-\\ncorporated into trials by a range of commercial airlines, ranging in feedstock from Jatropha, residual forestry \\nwaste for alcohol-based fuels, to coconut oils used in blends. \\nClassification of biofuels as SAF is contingent upon the conditions under which the biomass is to be sourced, \\nand will deliver, at most, carbon neutral performance.\\nKey Implementa-\\ntion Milestones\\nPolicy / Technical Assistance Investment Needs\\n•\\t Achieving annual market updates on cost-\\neffectiveness and availability of SAF sources.\\n•\\t  Achieving either full fuel subsidy support or cost-\\neffective subsidies to meet the cost-competitive fossil \\nfuel options available.\\nOutcomes\\nPrimary Outcomes\\n•\\t GHG emission reductions associated with domestic air travel.\\n•\\t A reliable, regular supply chain for SAF alternatives has been established through KOIL to fuel the Air \\nKiribati fleet.\\n•\\t Integration of biofuels into national-scale fuel mix.  \\nSecondary Outcomes\\n•\\t Fuel infrastructure and storage upgrades for KOIL facilities.\\nMitigation Poten -\\ntial\\n>756tCO2/yr and a total of >6,867tCO2 for 2020 - 2030\\nAssumed emissions reduction potential of 63,000tCO2e per annum under the (Intended) NDC may be eval-\\nuated in the context of the SREP Investment Plan, which attributed only 4% of total national emissions to do-\\nmestic aviation (2,520tCO2e). The totals above also assume 3.6% average Compound Annual Growth Rate \\n(CAGR) estimated for the aviation market globally by IATA, which would result in 33,289tCO2 to potentially \\nmitigate over the 2020-2030 period.

Additionally, the scaling barriers to cost-competitive uptake of new SAFs need to be reme-\\ndied at a global market level, as SAF supply is insufficient for the current demand by larger air carriers \\nattempting to  decarbonise both domestic operations and international flights under ICAO CORSIA \\ncompliance requirements. \\n•\\t Kiribati will only be able to take advantage of available SAFs if trade arrangements are made (possibly \\njointly placing orders with airlines in NZ or Australia if delivered from outside the region.) \\n•\\t Attributing a subsidy to fuel for air travel may create competition issues with the maritime shipping sec-\\ntor, and claims of favouritism would have to be addressed and ameliorated prior to going forward with \\nany financing arrangements.\\nFinancial Sustain -\\nability\\nWithout an external partner willing to subsidize more than 100% of the cost of Kiribati’s aviation fuel, or tech-\\nnological breakthroughs occur alongside a significant increase in SAF supply, financing the adoption of SAF \\nfor Kiribati’s aviation activities cannot be considered sustainable given the current market outlook.
