      <div class="col-xs-12"><h2 id="toca">A. Overview</h2>

<p>Climate change and the global response to the threats it poses have the potential to significantly impact the safety and soundness of federally regulated financial institutions (FRFIs), and the financial system more broadly. These risks, also known as “climate-related risks,” are broadly categorized as physical and transition risks.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>“Physical risks” refer to the financial risks from the increasing severity and frequency of climate-related extremes and events (i.e., acute physical risks); longer-term gradual shifts of the climate (i.e., chronic physical risks); and indirect effects of climate change such as public health implications (e.g., morbidity and mortality impacts).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>“Transition risks” refer to the financial risks related to the process of adjustment towards a low-greenhouse gas (GHG) economy. These risks can emerge from current or future government policies, legislation, and regulation to limit GHG emissions, as well as technological advancements, and changes in market and customer sentiment towards a low-GHG economy.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Physical and transition risks can also lead to liability risks, such as the risk of climate-related claims under liability policies, as well as litigation and direct actions against financial institutions for failing to manage their climate-related risks.</p>

<p>Climate-related risks may manifest over varying time horizons, and are likely to intensify over time, especially if the global economy undergoes a disorderly transition. They can drive financial risks, such as credit, market, insurance, and liquidity risks. They can also lead to strategic, operational, and reputational risks. In severe instances, climate-related risks can threaten the long-term viability of a FRFI’s business model.</p>

<p>Building resilience against climate-related risks requires FRFIs to address vulnerabilities in their business model, their overall operations, and ultimately on their balance sheet. This entails forward-looking approaches that are holistic, integrated, and built on reliable empirical data and sound analyses. It also necessitates FRFIs to continuously monitor and incorporate developments in climate-related risk management, such as improving data quality and evolving risk measurement methodologies, into their governance and risk management practices.</p>

<h3 id="toca1">A1. Purpose and scope</h3>

<p>The Guideline establishes OSFI’s expectations related to the FRFI’s management of climate-related risks. It aims to support FRFIs in developing greater resilience to, and management of, these risks. The Guideline applies to all FRFIs except foreign bank branches.<fn value="1">‘Foreign bank branches’ refers to foreign banks authorized to carry on business in Canada on a branch basis under Part XII.1 of the &lt;cite&gt;Bank Act&lt;/cite&gt;.</fn><fn value="2">This Guideline applies to Canadian branches of foreign insurers to the extent the expectations relate to, or impact, the risks insured in Canada by the foreign insurer, the sufficiency of the related vested assets relative to the foreign insurer’s insurance business in Canada, and/or and the Branch Adequacy Asset Test (BAAT) or Life Insurance Margin Adequacy Test (LIMAT) targets.</fn></p>

<div class="bg-info padded-sm">
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all approach for managing climate-related risks given the unique risks and vulnerabilities that will vary with a FRFI’s size, nature, scope, and complexity of its operations, and risk profile. The Guideline should be read, and implemented, from a risk-based perspective that allows the FRFI to compete effectively while managing its climate-related risks prudently.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="toca2">A2. Structure of the Guideline</h3>

<p>The Guideline is organized into chapters, each with its own focus and principles-based expectations. These chapters are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. For example, enhanced transparency through climate-related financial disclosures (Chapter 2) incentivizes improvements in the quality of the FRFI’s governance and risk management practices (Chapter 1).</p>

<h3 id="toca3">A3. Outcomes</h3>

<p>The Guideline presents the following three expected outcomes for FRFIs to achieve.</p>

<div class="bg-info padded-sm">
<ol>
	<li>The FRFI understands and mitigates against potential impacts of climate-related risks to its <strong>business model and strategy</strong>.</li>
	<li>The FRFI has appropriate <strong>governance and risk management practices</strong> to manage identified climate-related risks.</li>
	<li>The FRFI remains <strong>financially resilient</strong> through severe, yet plausible, climate risk scenarios, and <strong>operationally resilient</strong> through disruption due to climate-related disasters.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2 id="toc1">Chapter 1 – Governance and risk management expectations</h2>

<p>This chapter outlines OSFI’s governance and risk management expectations for climate-related risks. It complements and should be read in conjunction with other OSFI guidance that directly or indirectly addresses various elements of climate risk management. See <a href="#ann1.1">Annex 1-1</a> for a non-exhaustive list of relevant OSFI guidance.</p>

<h3 id="toc1.1">I. Governance</h3>

<div class="bg-info padded-sm">
<p>Principle 1: The FRFI should have the appropriate governance and accountability structure in place to manage climate-related risks.</p>

<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="well">
<p><strong>Climate scenario analysis</strong>: Climate scenario analysis uses a hypothetical future state of the world to assess the impact of climate-related risks on a FRFI's operations. These exercises can help the FRFI achieve different objectives in its strategic planning and enterprise risk management, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assessing the impact of physical and transition risks on the FRFI’s strategy and risk profile, and the resiliency of its business model;</li>
	<li>Identifying relevant climate-related risk factors that can drive the FRFI’s financial and non-financial risks, and estimating exposures and potential losses;</li>
	<li>Identifying data, methodology, and assumption limitations; and</li>
	<li>Informing the adequacy of the FRFI’s risk management framework.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol start="11">
	<li>
	<p>When undertaking climate scenario analyses, the FRFI should consider a range of plausible and relevant models and climate scenarios, over various time horizons (i.e., short-, medium- and long-term), when climate-related risks can materialize and drive the FRFI’s risks.<fn value="7">When selecting relevant climate scenarios, the FRFI should consider industry-accepted sources, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). The FRFI should also consider domestic and global policies and legislation, such as the &lt;cite&gt;Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act&lt;/cite&gt;.</fn></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The FRFI should consider climate scenarios that encompass both physical and transition risks, and the potential interplay between these two types of risks. The FRFI should also understand the methodology and approaches used, including data and methodological limitations, and assumptions.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<div class="well">
<p>In addition to FRFIs’ own internal climate scenario analysis to understand the resilience of their business model and strategy, FRFIs will be required to complete standardized climate scenario exercises and report their results to OSFI on a periodic basis.

<h2 id="toc2">Chapter 2 – Climate-related financial disclosures</h2>

<p>This chapter outlines OSFI’s expectations for the disclosure of climate-related risks.</p>

<h3 id="toc2.1">I. Purpose of disclosure expectations</h3>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>OSFI reinforces its climate risk management expectations through climate-related financial disclosure expectations. Climate-related financial disclosures help OSFI to meet its mandate of protecting depositors, creditors, and policyholders, and contributing to public confidence in the Canadian financial system, by ensuring relevant information is publicly available to enable understanding of FRFIs’ financial condition and the risks to which they are exposed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Users interested in FRFIs’ climate-related financial risk information may also include investors, analysts, and the public at large. By providing this broad group of users with relevant risk and risk management information, these disclosures can build confidence in FRFI management, and enable FRFIs to attract, or maintain their access to, capital and liquidity channels. By extension, confidence in FRFIs contributes to the public confidence in, and resilience of, the Canadian financial system.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc2.2">II. Scope of application</h3>

<ol start="3">
	<li>
	<p>This chapter applies to all FRFIs in the scope of this Guideline, except for subsidiaries of FRFIs that report consolidated results to OSFI.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This Guideline expects FRFI-specific disclosures at the highest consolidated level. The in-scope FRFI is permitted to reference non-FRFI parent-level or group-level disclosures, for disclosure elements common to both in-scope FRFI and non-FRFI parent or group, for the corresponding reporting period.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc2.3">III. Principles for effective disclosure of climate-related risks</h3>

<ol start="5">
	<li>
	<p>The fundamental principles set out below provide guidance to FRFIs on OSFI’s expectations for climate-related financial risk disclosures. These principles can help achieve high-quality and decision-useful disclosures that enable users to understand the financial impact of climate change on FRFIs. FRFIs should present disclosures that reflect the principles below.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The FRFI may encounter tension in the application of the principles set out below, whether between principles or within a single principle.<fn value="8">For example, the FRFI may update a methodology or increase the level of detail disclosed to improve the relevance of disclosure, at the expense of consistency of disclosure. Tension can also arise within a single principle. For example, Principle 4 states that disclosures should be verifiable, but assumptions made about future-oriented disclosures often require significant judgment by FRFI management that is difficult to verify.</fn> Such tensions are inevitable given the wide-ranging and sometimes competing needs of users and preparers of disclosures. The FRFI should aim to find an appropriate balance of disclosures that reasonably satisfy the expectations and principles without overwhelming users with unnecessary information.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>OSFI expects a FRFI to continually look to evolve its disclosure practices, and to regularly review disclosures for relevance, comprehensiveness, and clarity.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<div class="bg-info padded-sm mrgn-bttm-md">
<p>Principle 1: The FRFI should disclose relevant information.</p>
</div>

<ol start="8">
	<li>
	<p>The FRFI should provide information specific to the current and potential future impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on its markets, businesses, corporate or investment strategy, financial statements and reports, and future cash flows.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The FRFI should present disclosures in sufficient detail to enable users to assess its exposure and approach to addressing climate-related risks, which is expected to evolve over time as FRFI practices mature.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The FRFI should provide information from the perspective of the current and potential future impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on value creation, considering and addressing the different time frames and types of impacts.</p>

</ol>

<div class="bg-info padded-sm mrgn-bttm-md">
<p>Principle 2: The FRFI should disclose specific and comprehensive information.<fn value="9">As data quality, availability and scenario analysis capabilities improve, OSFI expects to issue updated climate-related financial disclosure expectations in the future with increased expectations.</fn></p>

<ol start="11">
	<li>
	<p>The FRFI should provide disclosures of its exposure to current and potential future impacts of physical and transition risks; the potential nature and size of such impacts; the FRFI’s governance, strategy, processes for managing these risks, and performance with respect to managing climate-related risks and opportunities.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>To be sufficiently comprehensive, the FRFI should include historical and future-oriented information in its disclosures to allow users to evaluate their previous expectations relative to actual performance and assess possible future financial implications.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For quantitative information, the FRFI should use data that is consistent with what is used in its investment and risk management decision-making. The FRFI should provide an explanation of the definition, measurement framework used, scope applied, and for future-oriented information, the key assumptions and judgments used. The FRFI should explain any data limitations and/or methodology challenges it faced during the reporting period and their impact on disclosure.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Any scenario analyses should be based on data or other information used by the FRFI for investment decision-making and risk management. Where appropriate, the FRFI should also demonstrate the effect on selected risk metrics or exposures of changes in the key underlying methodologies and assumptions, both in qualitative and quantitative terms.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Management should exercise discretion to avoid disclosing proprietary and/or confidential information.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<div class="bg-info padded-sm mrgn-bttm-md">
<p>Principle 3: The FRFI should disclose clear, balanced, and understandable information.</p>
</div>

<ol start="16">
	<li>
	<p>The FRFI should present disclosures that communicate financial information that serves the needs of a range of users (i.e., sufficiently granular to inform sophisticated users but also provide concise information for those who are less specialized.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The FRFI should show an appropriate balance between qualitative and quantitative information and use text, numbers, and graphical presentations in its disclosures as appropriate.</p>

	<li>
	<p>To the extent practicable, the FRFI should base its disclosures on objective data and use best-in-class measurement methodologies, which would include common industry practice as it evolves.</p>

	<p>The FRFI should adequately explain future-oriented disclosures that involve the FRFI’s judgment and ensure such disclosures are reasonable and supported.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The disclosures should be subject to internal governance processes and controls that are the same or substantially like those used for financial reporting.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The disclosures are not expected to be subject to independent external assurance at this time, but FRFIs should work towards a future state in which external assurance is expected.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Principle 6: The FRFI should disclose information consistently over time.</p>
</div>

<ol start="27">
